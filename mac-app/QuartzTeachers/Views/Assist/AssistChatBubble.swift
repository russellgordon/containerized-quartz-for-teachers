/// against a side-by-side comparison, which corrected one of the originals:
/// the "corner radius 12" below is Messages' MULTI-LINE radius; a single-line
/// bubble is a capsule (see `capsuleLimit`), and the tail ratios below were
/// confirmed exactly (tip inset 0.42r, drop 0.33r, corner end 0.54r).
///
/// | | |
/// |---|---|
/// | corner radius, multi-line | 17 |
/// | corner radius, single line | half the body height |
/// | text inset, sides | 11 |
/// | tail drop below the body | 5.7, one size for every bubble |
/// | tail tip, INSIDE the body's edge | 7 |
///
/// Two of those corrected assumptions worth stating, because both look right
/// until measured. The tail **hangs below** the bubble — it is not level with
/// the bottom edge. And it stays **within the bubble's width**: its tip is
/// seven points INSIDE the right edge, not outside it. A tail drawn
/// past the side reads as a wedge stuck onto the corner, which is what the
/// last version was.
///
/// So the bubble is a rounded rectangle whose bottom corner, on the speaker's
/// side, dips into a small hook. The hook's underside is concave, curving back
/// up into the bottom edge — that curve, rather than the tip, is what makes
/// the shape read as a tail.

/// tall one are the same design, and everything is drawn inside the rect the

/// How a teacher's class dates get IN.
///
/// `SectionTimetable` remembers the days a section meets, and everything that
/// dates a class page reads them from there. What it does not say is where the
/// list came from in the first place. A teacher has one — in a shared Google
/// Sheet the office published, in a file they exported, or simply in front of
/// them ready to be pasted — and this turns any of those three into calendar
/// days.
///
/// **The reading happens here, in Swift, and never in the assistant's model.**
/// That is the whole point of this file. The assistant's job is to notice that
/// a timetable is missing and offer this; it never reads the column itself. So
/// the small model a teacher runs on their own Mac is exactly as capable at
/// this as any model in a data centre, and neither of them can invent a date
/// that was not in the file — the failure that would be hardest to catch,
/// because a plausible wrong date looks exactly like a right one.
///
/// The other thing worth stating out loud is about ordering. `08/09/2026` is
/// the 8th of September to a Canadian teacher reading a British colleague's
/// spreadsheet and the 9th of August to an American one, and there is no way
/// to tell from the value alone. Guessing puts a teacher's classes months from
/// where they belong, and they do not find out until a class page appears on
/// the wrong day in November.
///
/// So it is never guessed. But it is not refused either, because their
/// spreadsheet is not WRONG — it just does not say. First the column is asked:
/// one value anywhere in it with a number above 12 settles the whole thing,
/// and most columns have one. Only when nothing in the column can settle it
/// does this hand back a QUESTION for the teacher, quoting one of their own
/// dates read both ways. That is one click, and then the answer applies to
/// every row at once.

# Windows Testing Brief — WSL2 Container Runtime Path

> **Audience:** a Claude Code session running on the maintainer's Windows 11 Pro

## Mission

The toolchain recently **dropped its Docker Desktop requirement**. On
Windows, the PowerShell launchers (`setup.ps1`, `preview.ps1`, `deploy.ps1`)
now provision and use the **Docker Engine inside WSL2** automatically. That
code was written and parse-checked on macOS but has **never executed on a
real Windows machine**. Your job: exercise it end to end on this machine,
find what breaks, fix it, and report.

## Background (5-minute orientation)

- This repo publishes teaching websites from Obsidian vaults using a Docker
  container that wraps a patched Quartz v4.5.0. There is **no registry**:
  the launchers hash the folder's build recipe and build the image locally
  as `teaching-quartz:src-<hash8>` (`Get-BuildContext` / `Get-ToolchainHash`
  / `Build-ImageIfMissing` in the `.ps1` files). Full architecture docs:
  [`documentation/README.md`](documentation/README.md),
  especially [`documentation/03-launcher-scripts.md`](documentation/03-launcher-scripts.md)
  (the section "Container runtime bootstrap" describes exactly what you are testing).
- The teacher-facing flow is: `setup.bat` (interactive course wizard) →
  `preview.bat COURSE SECTION` (build + serve; the launcher prints the
  host address — each working folder gets its own probed port block) →
  `deploy.bat COURSE SECTION` (delta deploy to Netlify).
- Each `.bat` is a thin wrapper that runs the `.ps1` beside it.
- The macOS counterpart of this change (Colima) is **already tested and
  working** — treat the `.sh` scripts as the reference for intended behaviour.

## What the new Windows code does

In each of the three `.ps1` scripts, near the top, there is an identical
block: `Ensure-ContainerRuntime` plus helpers. Its intended behaviour:

1. **Fast path:** if a native `docker` (docker.exe) works, use it unchanged.
2. Otherwise require `wsl` + an installed distribution (else print
   `wsl --install` guidance and exit).
3. Probe `wsl -e docker info` as the default user, then as root
   (`$global:WslUserArgs = @('-u','root')`).
4. If the engine is missing inside WSL, offer to install it:
   `apt-get install docker.io` as root, then `usermod -aG docker <user>`.
5. Start it with `wsl -u root -e sh -c "service docker start"` and poll.
6. On success, define `function global:docker { & wsl $global:WslUserArgs -e docker @args }`
   so every later `docker …` call in the script transparently routes through
   WSL. Bind-mount paths are translated with `Get-MountPath` (wslpath →
   `/mnt/c/...`). `deploy.ps1` additionally has two
   `System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo` invocations that bypass PowerShell
   command resolution — these use `$DOCKER_EXE` / `$DOCKER_PREFIX` variables
   instead.

## Environment notes for this machine

- Windows 11 Pro (build 26100), PowerShell 5.1 minimum target (also test
  under `pwsh` 7 if installed).
- Clone/pull this repo; **test the repo's `.ps1` files directly** (in
  production they reach teachers via the app's `.toolchain/` mirror).
- The repo stores files with **LF line endings** (depending on
  `core.autocrlf`, your checkout may or may not have CRLF). PowerShell
  handles LF `.ps1` fine. If a `.bat` misbehaves with LF endings, invoke the
  `.ps1` directly (`powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1`)
  and note the finding — in production, teachers receive CRLF copies (the
  image build runs `unix2dos`).
- The container image is **built locally by the launcher on first run**
  (BuildKit required — `Ensure-Buildx`); expect the first run to take a few
  minutes and to need the network. A changed recipe changes the tag and
  rebuilds.
- `courses/` is gitignored — a fresh clone has no courses. The setup wizard
  offers to install an Example Course (**EXC2O**); say yes and use it as the
  test fixture throughout.

## Test plan (in order)

Work through these scenarios; after each, note PASS/FAIL and any output worth
keeping.

**1. Static review.** Read `Ensure-ContainerRuntime` in all three `.ps1`
files and flag anything that cannot work on PowerShell 5.1 before running
anything.

**2. Specific mechanisms I could not verify from macOS** — test these in an
interactive PowerShell first:
   - Empty-array argument flattening: `$e = @(); wsl $e -e echo hi` — confirm
     no stray empty argument reaches wsl (this pattern underpins
     `Test-WslDockerReady` and the `docker` function).
   - `$env:WSL_UTF8='1'; wsl -l -q` — confirm clean, parseable distro names.
   - `Get-Command docker -CommandType Application` behaves on PS 5.1 when no
     docker.exe exists (should return nothing, not throw).
   - After `usermod -aG docker <user>`, does `wsl -e docker info` work
     without `wsl --shutdown`? (The scripts fall back to root if not — confirm
     the fallback engages.)

**3. Scenario: engine not installed.** If this machine's WSL distro has no
Docker engine (or remove it: `wsl -u root -e sh -c "apt-get remove -y docker.io"`),
run `.\preview.ps1 EXC2O 1 --build-only` (after setup) or `.\setup.ps1` and
confirm the install offer appears, works, and the run continues to success.

**4. Scenario: engine stopped.** `wsl --shutdown`, then run a launcher —
confirm it starts the engine itself and proceeds.

**5. Scenario: engine running (fast path).** Re-run immediately — confirm no
install/start work is repeated.

**6. End-to-end teacher flow.**
   - `.\setup.bat` → install the Example Course (EXC2O).
   - `.\preview.bat EXC2O 1` → confirm the container is created with a
     `/mnt/c/...` mount, the build succeeds, and `http://localhost:8081`
     renders in a Windows browser (WSL2 localhost forwarding).
   - Check interactive fidelity through the `wsl`-routed `docker exec -it`:
     wizard prompts, and especially the arrow-key colour scheme picker if you
     run a full course setup.
   - `.\preview.bat EXC2O 1 --build-only` then, **only if a Netlify token for
     a throwaway account is available**, `.\deploy.bat EXC2O 1`. Deploys
     create real Netlify sites — skip otherwise and note as untested.

**7. Edge cases.**
   - Run from a folder whose path contains spaces (e.g.
     `C:\Users\<me>\Class Websites Test\`) — mount translation and quoting.
   - Move the folder, run again — the container NAME is derived from the
     folder's path hash, so a moved folder gets a brand-new container (and
     the old one is left stopped); confirm the new one mounts the new
     `/mnt/c/...` path.
   - Two working folders at once: confirm each gets its own container
     (`teaching-quartz-<hash>`) and its own host port block (bases 8081,
     8091, …, each with a +1000 websocket block), and that two previews can
     run simultaneously.
   - `.\preview.ps1 EXC2O 1 --port 8082` — the per-preview port flag.
   - After any build, confirm the merged output contains the generated
     social sharing card (`.merged_output/section1/quartz/static/og-image.png`
     should be a title card in the course's colours, not the stock Quartz
     crystal — the card is drawn by `scripts/social_card.py` inside the
     container, so no Windows-side work is involved).
   - `deploy.ps1`'s token-injection steps (the `ProcessStartInfo` ones) — the
     `$DOCKER_PREFIX` quoting through `wsl.exe` is the riskiest untested
     code; verify `/tmp/netlify_pat` arrives in the container intact
     (test with a dummy: pipe text through the same command shape).

## When you find problems

- Fix them in the working tree, keeping the structure parallel across the
  three `.ps1` files (the block is intentionally identical in each) and
  consistent with the `.sh` reference behaviour.
- Commit to a branch named `windows-wsl2-fixes` with clear messages; do not
  push to `main` directly.
- Finish with a summary: scenarios run, PASS/FAIL each, fixes made, and
  anything that remains untested (e.g., a true fresh `wsl --install` if this
  machine already had WSL).

## Ground rules

- Never uninstall WSL or delete existing WSL distros without asking first.
- Images are only ever built locally; there is nothing to publish.
- Netlify deploys are opt-in only (they create public sites).
- The `.sh` files are macOS-only — do not "fix" them on Windows.

## Results — 2026-08-11 (Claude Code, maintainer's Windows 11 machine)

Run on Windows 11 Pro 26200, WSL 2.5.10 (no distro pre-installed —
Ubuntu-24.04 installed for the tests), Docker Engine 29.1.3 inside WSL,
PowerShell 5.1. Fixes were committed to **main** at the maintainer's
direction (overriding this brief's branch instruction). Interactive
runs were driven through `windows-app/PtyDriver`, a ConPTY harness that
gives the launchers a real TTY.

**1. Static review — FAIL → fixed.** Beyond parse-checks (clean), five
faults found and repaired: (a) preview.ps1's image resolution was
inverted — every run without `--image` printed "missing the toolchain's
build recipe" and exited 1; (b) a single trailing flag arrived as a
STRING, so `$Flags[0]` indexed characters ("Unknown option: -") — now
always an array; (c) the three scripts hashed different paths for the
container name (setup hashed the invocation directory before its
Set-Location; casing changed the hash) — all three now hash the
folder's physical path via GetFinalPathNameByHandle, after
Set-Location; (d) no exit-code propagation from the final docker exec;
(e) `Ensure-Buildx` guarded WSL work with an always-true null check.
Also: under `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'`, PS 5.1 turns wsl.exe
stderr into TERMINATING errors at any redirected call site — probes
that legitimately fail (inspecting a not-yet-built image) killed the
script. The global docker wrapper now relaxes the preference around the
wsl call. Two milestone lines the app watches for were added
("Setting up this PC - a one-time step ...", and preview's
"Starting container if needed ...").

**2. Mechanism checks — PASS.** Empty-array flattening (`wsl $e -e
echo hi` → clean), `WSL_UTF8=1` distro names parse, `Get-Command
docker` returns nothing without throwing when no docker.exe exists.
usermod fallback untested (the test distro runs as root by default).

**3. Engine not installed — PASS (command path).** `apt-get install
docker.io` inside WSL (the script's exact command) installed engine
29.1.3; the interactive install-offer prompt itself was not exercised
end-to-end (the engine was installed before the first full run).

**4. Engine stopped — PASS.** `service docker start` + poll brought the
engine up from cold.

**5. Fast path — PASS.** With the engine running, no install/start work
repeats; runs go straight to the container checks.

**6. End-to-end teacher flow — PASS.**
- `setup.ps1 --install-example`: image built locally from the recipe
  (BuildKit via buildx in WSL), container `teaching-quartz-<hash8>`
  created with `/mnt/c/...` mount, EXC2O installed, and
  `EXAMPLE_COURSE_CODE=EXC2O` printed for the app.
- `preview.ps1 EXC2O 1`: "Preview will be available at:
  http://localhost:8081/" announced; page served HTTP 200 with the
  correct title through WSL2 localhost forwarding.
- Interactive fidelity through the wsl-routed `docker exec -it`:
  works under a pseudo console — with one CRITICAL caveat: the process
  that creates the ConPTY must not itself have redirected stdio, or
  the child inherits stale pipe handles and wsl reports "the input
  device is not a TTY". (The Plantoir app, a GUI process, is naturally
  clean.)
- `deploy.ps1 EXC2O 1` with a throwaway token pre-stored in Credential
  Manager: Netlify site created, 233 files uploaded with streaming
  counts, "✅ Deploy complete.", exit 0, site live over https. The
  first-run token-paste prompt was not exercised (token pre-stored);
  `/tmp/netlify_pat` injection via ProcessStartInfo worked — the token
  reached the container intact.

**7. Edge cases.** Two-folder concurrency, moved-folder recreation,
spaces-in-path, and `--port` were NOT yet exercised on this machine
(the per-folder hash and port-block logic are covered by unit tests in
`windows-app/Plantoir.Tests`). The generated social card was verified
present after the build (`.merged_output/section1/quartz/static/
og-image.png`, 28 KB, drawn in-container). Remaining scenarios are the
first candidates for the next session.

**Untested overall:** a true fresh `wsl --install` (WSL itself was
already present), the docker-group/usermod fallback, and pwsh 7 runs
(everything above ran under Windows PowerShell 5.1).

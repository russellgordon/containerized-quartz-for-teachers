# To Do

Ideas and deferred work, in no particular order. Add items freely; remove
an item when it ships (finished behaviour is recorded in
[`GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md), not here).

- **A recreated container publishes pages the teacher HID** — found
  2026-08-17, while re-shooting the marketing screenshots. Highest-severity
  item on this list: it exposes material a teacher deliberately held back.

  The Explorer's hide list works through a `filterFn` in
  `quartz.layout.ts` carrying a `CQ4T-OMIT-ANCHOR` marker. That block is
  written by `setup_course.py`'s `ensure_quartz_explorer_anchor()`, which
  patches `/opt/quartz/quartz.layout.ts` **inside the running container**.
  It is NOT in the image: `docker run --rm <image> grep -c CQ4T-OMIT-ANCHOR
  /opt/quartz/quartz.layout.ts` returns 0. `build_site.py` only overwrites
  the CONTENTS of the `omit` Set; it cannot create the filter.

  So any container recreation loses it — and recreation is the documented
  design whenever the recipe hash changes, i.e. after most toolchain
  updates. The next preview then copies a pristine scaffold, and
  `ensure_quartz_layout_anchor()` injects a bare `const omit = new Set([])`
  "to unblock the build". The Set is then populated and **nothing consumes
  it**, because there is no filter. The build succeeds, and Curriculum,
  Learning Goals, Help Sessions, Key Links and Private Notes all appear on
  the class site.

  Reproduced: `docker rm -f` the working folder's container, then rebuild
  three courses. All three came back with `filterFn` absent and two
  warnings printed (`Expected omit set not found`, `Sidebar omit anchor not
  found`) — and a site that hides nothing. Running
  `ensure_quartz_explorer_anchor()` in the container fixed all three.

  The fix, in order of value: **bake the anchored Explorer block into the
  IMAGE** (the Dockerfile already copies `patches/Explorer.tsx`, so this
  belongs beside it) so every container has it from birth and setup's patch
  becomes a harmless no-op rather than the only source of truth; make the
  build's fallback inject the real block instead of a bare Set, so existing
  containers self-heal; and **stop treating a missing filter as a
  warning** — "about to publish pages the teacher hid" should refuse to
  build, not print a line. Gated by `verify.sh`.

- **Nothing verifies that a release actually reached plantoir.app** — noted
  2026-08-14. The `cut-release` skill ends by saying the push "redeploys
  plantoir.app automatically (Netlify watches `site/`)" and stops there. No
  check that Netlify's build succeeded, and no check that the live site
  serves the new version. The download links on that page are load-bearing
  for every teacher, so a cheap post-push fetch of `https://plantoir.app`
  confirming the `version-note` line matches the tag would be worth having.

- **Container recreation can kill live previews** — noted 2026-08-11.
  Every launcher "ensures" the working folder's container, and on a
  toolchain-recipe hash or mount mismatch it recreates it (`docker rm
  -f`) — taking any live preview servers down with it. In steady state
  hashes match and this never triggers; it can bite mid-session only in
  rare cases (e.g. an app update refreshing `.toolchain` while another
  window previews). A thorough fix would make the ensure-container step
  decline (or warn) when the container hosts running previews. Low
  priority — rare, and the next preview self-heals.

- **Write the publishing documentation for plantoir.app** — noted
  2026-08-12, once Cloudflare Pages shipped. The app now offers three
  destinations and the picker's captions can only carry so much; the
  website should explain the choice properly. Worth covering: which
  destination suits whom (Netlify as the default; Cloudflare Pages for
  unmetered bandwidth and a free per-section address; a folder for
  teachers whose board gives them their own web space); how to create a
  token for each, with the exact permission Cloudflare needs (Account →
  Cloudflare Pages → Edit) and the fact that a Pages token cannot list
  its own account, which is why the app asks for an Account ID once; and
  the 25 MB per-file limit — documents, images, and slide decks are
  comfortably under it, long-form video is not, and embedding from
  YouTube or Vimeo (what most teachers do anyway) sidesteps it entirely.
  The in-app orange note says the short version; the site should say the
  rest. Screenshots of the Publishing section would help.

- **Hosting options for teachers who can't use Cloudflare or Netlify** —
  researched 2026-08-12, for the documentation above. **The most useful
  finding reframes the question: the "a folder on this PC" destination is
  already the universal answer.** Any teacher with web space of any kind —
  board-provided, a university account, cPanel shared hosting, a NAS —
  can publish to a folder and upload it however they like. No new
  integration is needed for the "my board gives me space" case, and the
  documentation should say so prominently rather than implying Netlify or
  Cloudflare are the only ways.

  That leaves two narrower cases. *Can't create an account with a US
  service* (board policy, privacy rules): the honest answer is that most
  alternatives are also US-hosted, so the realistic options are the folder
  route or a jurisdiction-specific host — **Codeberg Pages** (run by a
  German non-profit) is the notable non-US free option, though it is
  git-based like GitHub Pages. *Wants something free and simpler*:
  **Neocities** is the interesting one — free tier, ad-free, explicitly
  education-friendly, a privacy pledge including no AI training on user
  content, and, unusually for a small host, a documented HTTP API plus a
  CLI with a recursive directory push, which is exactly the shape
  Plantoir needs. Its free tier is small (~1 GB, no custom domain
  without paying) and its branding is hobbyist, so it suits a class site
  more than a department site.

  Ranked for *integration* effort, ignoring what is already built:
  Cloudflare (done), GitHub Pages (deferred above, subpath question
  open), Neocities (small, API-shaped, needs verification), Codeberg
  (git-based, EU). **Vercel stays ruled out** — its Hobby plan forbids
  commercial use in terms broad enough to cover a salaried teacher's
  work; see the earlier assessment. Low-cost rather than free, if a
  teacher will pay a little: Bunny.net storage plus CDN is about a dollar
  a month, and any cPanel host at a few dollars a month already works
  today through the folder route.

  **Caveat on the numbers:** much of the comparison material online is
  affiliate SEO content of low reliability. The Cloudflare, Netlify and
  GitHub figures cited elsewhere in this file were verified directly
  against the vendors; the Neocities and Codeberg specifics were not, and
  need checking before either is documented as a recommendation, let
  alone integrated.

- **GitHub Pages as a third publishing destination** — deferred 2026-08-12.
  Requested by CLI-era users (summer 2025). Feasible and well-bounded, but
  not now. What's known: the Quartz-docs GitHub-template route (build stock
  Quartz in Actions CI) does NOT fit — Plantoir builds patched Quartz
  v4.5.0 locally, so the right route is push-the-built-output to a branch
  Pages serves, written once in the shared `deploy.py` (git is already in
  the container). Videos are fine: GitHub Pages serves 206 Partial Content
  with proper Content-Range (verified empirically 2026-08-12), which is
  what Safari's `<video>` needs; limits are 100 MB/file (hard), ~1 GB/site,
  100 GB/month soft bandwidth — same soft cap as Netlify free. Token story
  parallels Netlify: fine-grained PAT (`contents: read/write`, one repo);
  repo creation + Pages enablement automatable via API. The UI seam already
  exists from rows 101–102 (`deploy_target` picker, milestones, launcher
  flag). Open questions, answerable with a one-session hand-run spike
  (push a built Test 3 section to a throwaway repo) BEFORE any UI work:
  (1) subpath hosting — each section would live at
  `username.github.io/<repo>`, and our patched build has never carried a
  path component in `baseUrl`; (2) Quartz's trailing-slash caveat on Pages
  (`file.html`, no redirect — mostly bites hand-written external links);
  (3) deploy latency (~a minute to go live — milestone wording should say
  "on its way", and the output needs a `.nojekyll`). Shared work: deploy.py
  plus both GUIs — write a proposal note for the mac side (like
  research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md, part 3) when picking this up.

- **Publish stops an active preview itself** — deferred 2026-08-11. The
  idea: the Publish button stays enabled while a preview runs; clicking it
  stops this section's preview, waits for it to end, then publishes —
  saving the teacher the Stop Preview click. A first attempt was rolled
  back: pressing Publish while a preview was still *building* (not yet
  serving) left the app in an indeterminate state. The tricky moment is a
  build-phase preview — the console's ownership, the preview lease, the
  waiting-for-server state, and the publish's own needs-rebuild decision
  are all in flight at once, so stopping and handing off needs a real
  design pass rather than a stop-and-wait bolted onto `startDeploy`. Not
  urgent.

- **AI Assist — the rest of it**, updated 2026-08-14 after a full
  live-tested day on the `ai-assist` branch, since folded into `main`
  (not yet in any tagged release). The
  Windows in-app assistant is now **working end to end**: approval gate
  (deploys only), embedded model with a verified once-ever prompt cache,
  the promise card handled as deterministic commands, page edits doing
  stop-edit-offer around the app's own preview, and the whole loop moved
  to `Plantoir.Core` with tests covering every promise —
  [`research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md`](research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md) part 2 §10 is the record, and
  `MAC-HANDOFF.md` carries the mac side's pickup entry. What remains:

  **(a) The CSV reschedule — built; what is left is around the edges.**
  It shipped in the plan-then-write shape this item asked for.
  `Plantoir.Core/Assist/Timetable.cs` reads a school's sheet without
  assuming its layout — which row is the header, which column holds dates,
  and how the dates are written are all worked out from the sheet itself —
  and `ReDatePlan.cs` produces the diff table shown before anything is
  written. The MCP surface is `read_timetable` → `plan_re_date_classes` →
  `re_date_classes`, plus `roll_over_section` for a new year, all in
  `Plantoir.Mcp/PlantoirTools.cs`, with tests in
  `Plantoir.Tests/TimetableTests.cs`. §5 of the handoff records 26 classes
  re-dated against a teacher's own spreadsheet, checked by an independent
  parser. Two things are genuinely left:

  * **Only CSV comes off disk.** `TimetableSource` reads a local file as
    plain text, or exports a shared Google Sheet by link. A teacher's
    `.xlsx` sitting in Downloads is neither, so they have to export it
    first — while the tool's own help text says “timetable.xlsx”.
  * **Which lesson lands on which day is still the model's call.**
    `plan_re_date_classes` takes matching `pages`/`meetings` lists and
    falls back to an even spread, which the description itself calls a
    starting point rather than an answer. That mapping is planning, and
    planning is where the measurements say the local model fails; it has
    not been measured on real phrasings.

  **(b) The shared activity lease, finished.** `WorkLease` files under the
  working folder now let the GUI decline a preview while the assistant
  builds, but the full both-directions story (server honouring the GUI's
  claims across every operation, and the mac app reading the same files)
  is still a shared-design item — agree the remaining shape with the mac
  side first.

  **(c) Re-measure the conversational residue.** The card's fixed shapes
  no longer touch the model, but the conversational phrasings that still
  do were last measured at 72% overall after the system-prompt rewrite
  (`research/ai-assist/promise-card-results.txt`), with undo over-salient
  and the deletion probe's decline lost. A prompt tweak plus a re-run of
  `trimmed-surface-suite.py` is a contained afternoon; every change to
  prompt or schemas retires the cache by design, so batch them.

- **A "prepare for start of year" operation, and the audit behind it** —
  deferred 2026-08-13, from a real session on the `ai-assist` branch.

  A teacher asked for "every class past Unit 1, Day 1, and everything those
  link to, into draft". Applied exactly, that rule left **32 course-level
  pages in SNC1W still published** that no class page links to at all — a
  whole unit's concepts, plus unassigned tasks and portfolio pages. The teacher
  spotted one (`Concepts/Astronomical Phenomena`, reachable only from an
  investigation that is itself unreferenced) and the rest fell out of an
  audit script.

  **The lesson: link-reachability is a weak proxy for "not yet taught."** A
  link-following rule cannot see a page no class links to, and those are
  precisely the pages a teacher has written ahead. If Plantoir grows a bulk
  start-of-year operation, base it on unit number, date, or an explicit
  teacher-facing "not yet taught" flag — not on what is reachable.

  The audit half of this shipped, as the read-only `check_section` tool in
  `Plantoir.Mcp/PlantoirTools.cs`. It cross-references a section's pages
  against every wikilink and reports two of the three groups: links on
  visible pages that lead to a hidden one (a student clicks and finds
  nothing), and pages nothing links to — still published, still listed in
  Quartz's explorer, and invisible to any rule that follows links. That
  second group is what proved the *rule* incomplete.

  What is still missing is the third group, **linked-but-missed**: pages a
  class does link to that a bulk change should have caught and did not. Its
  being empty is what proved the job complete, and `check_section` cannot
  say so today. Missing too is the bulk start-of-year operation itself —
  worth having with or without any AI, and per the lesson above it should
  key off unit number, date, or an explicit "not yet taught" flag rather
  than reachability. (`LinkGraph.cs`'s doc comment quotes 50 unreachable
  course-level pages, but for a "sample course" it does not name — a
  different measurement from the 32 above, not a contradiction of it.)

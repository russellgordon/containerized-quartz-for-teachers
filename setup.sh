Usage: ${SELF_CMD} [options] [-- <args passed to setup_course.py>]

Options:
  --image REF          Use a specific already-built image instead of building
                       from this folder's recipe (used by verify.sh).
  --context NAME       Use a specific Docker context (sets DOCKER_CONTEXT=NAME for this run).
  --no-backup          (Pass-through to setup_course.py) Skip creating a backup ZIP — you will be asked to confirm.
  --help               Show this help and exit.

Notes:
- The website builder image is built LOCALLY from this folder's recipe
  (.toolchain/, or the Dockerfile in a repository copy). The image tag is a
  hash of the recipe, so an updated recipe rebuilds automatically. The first
  build needs an internet connection and takes a few minutes; after that it
  is cached.
- Any arguments after a literal “--” are forwarded directly to setup_course.py.

Examples:
  ${SELF_CMD}
  ${SELF_CMD} --image quartz-teacher:dev-test
  ${SELF_CMD} -- --no-backup

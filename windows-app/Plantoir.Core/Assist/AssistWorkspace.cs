/// course at all — the small model proposed backing up "MCV4U", a code it

/// exist, never a best guess.
///
/// **The tools do the work; the assistant only picks one.** Given fine-grained
/// tools and asked to publish a class "and everything it links to", the model
/// chose the publish tool and silently skipped the link resolution, eight
/// times out of eight. Given one coarse tool that resolves links itself, it
/// got it right eight times out of eight. So link resolution, the choice
/// between <c>publish:</c> and <c>publishForSection&lt;N&gt;:</c>, the backup, the
/// rebuild and the publish are one operation here — not steps somebody else
/// sequences.
///
/// There is deliberately no delete, no archive and no overwrite. The model
/// declines what it has no tool for, which is why "delete the Unit 1 folder"
/// was harmless in testing; that property is worth keeping by construction.

# macOS App — Handoff

> **New here? Read [`MAC-BOOTSTRAP.md`](MAC-BOOTSTRAP.md) first.** It says how
> to take work that arrived from Windows, and how to add a feature on this side
> so it reaches them as data rather than as a surprise. This file is the ledger
> it sends you to.

The ledger of work that originated on the **Windows side** and needs — or
deserves a look from — the **macOS app**. The reverse of
[`WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`](WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md): read this when syncing the mac
after Windows-side sessions.

**Read it top-down and stop when you like.** Everything still owed is in the
first two sections; everything already dealt with is kept below them, in full,
because the reasoning is the point of the file and deleting a finished entry
throws away why the mac does what it does.

| Section | What is in it |
|---|---|
| [Contract cases waiting on the mac](#contract-cases-waiting-on-the-mac) | Cases proposed from Windows that the mac suite is failing on. Read FIRST when a suite goes red. |
| [Open — what the mac still owes](#open--what-the-mac-still-owes) | Work not yet done here. |
| [For awareness — no mac code needed](#for-awareness--no-mac-code-needed) | Things to KNOW, not to do: shared decisions, frozen names, coordination points. |
| [Done — the ledger](#done--the-ledger) | Finished, marked in place with what landed and where. History, and the reasoning behind decisions the code no longer explains. |

Cross-side rebases rewrite commit hashes, so treat hashes as hints from the
moment of writing — file and test names are the durable pointers.

## How to write an entry

The good entries below already do this; it is written down so the next one
does not have to infer it from twenty examples. An entry carries:

1. **A bold title that says what CHANGED**, then `(source, date, commit)` —
   "Windows", "shared", or "Windows + shared" for work in `scripts/`.
2. **What it fixed, and WHY it was done that way.** The why is the half that
   travels: the mac can read a diff, it cannot read a decision. Include what
   was **rejected**, or it gets proposed again and costs the same afternoon
   twice.
3. **Numbers, with the hardware they came from**, for anything measured. This
   side has no way to find out what a Windows teacher's machine does. "The
   Vulkan build was faster" cannot be acted on; "43 tok/s against 11 on CPU,
   Intel Iris Xe" can.
4. **Where the reference implementation lives** — file and test names, which
   outlast commit hashes across rebases.
5. **Whether the mac is expected to match it, or merely to know.** Those are
   different asks, and the second section of this file exists for the latter.

If a teacher can see the change, it also wants a row in
[`GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md) — that log is the record of the
product, not of one platform.

## Contract cases waiting on the mac

**Nothing waiting right now.** This section exists so that when something is,
it is the first thing read here — and so a red mac suite is instantly
explicable rather than alarming.

The mechanism, in one paragraph. `Plantoir --write-contracts` runs on the mac,
so the Windows side cannot regenerate the derived halves of
[`contracts/`](contracts/README.md) — but the **authored** halves (`scenarios`,
`nearMisses`, `promptHistory`, and the case lists in the other files) survive
regeneration untouched. So a behaviour invented on Windows can be proposed as
a case, and **the mac suite then fails until the mac implements it.** That is
the mechanism working, not a break: verified on purpose by adding a case for
an event the mac has no support for, which failed naming the case and the
missing step rather than passing quietly.

When a case is proposed, add a line here naming it, so whoever meets the red
suite reads it as a request:

> - `contracts/assist-cases.json` → `scenarios` → **"<case name>"**, proposed
>   <date>. What it asks for, and why. Reference: `<Windows file>`.

Remove the line when the mac implements it, and mark the matching entry below
`✅ DONE` — the ledger keeps the history, this section keeps only what is
outstanding.

## Open — what the mac still owes

**Nothing outstanding as of 2026-08-16.** Every item that arrived from the
Windows side has been dealt with and moved to the ledger below; the last one —
a test race around process-wide statics — was checked on 2026-08-16 and found
not to apply here.

New items go at the TOP of this section, and move to the ledger when done
rather than being deleted.

## For awareness — no mac code needed

- **Anything you build over there now owes a trail line** (mac, 2026-08-16).
  Plantoir keeps a breadcrumb trail so a problem reported next week can be
  looked into without asking the teacher to reproduce it, and the rule binds
  both sides: **every new feature, and every changed behaviour, that a teacher
  can see records an event.** The list lives in
  [`contracts/shared-rules.json`](contracts/shared-rules.json) →
  `activityTrail.mustRecord`, with `lineShape` and `promptMarker` beside it,
  and a test pins it against each app's own event list.

  The direction rule applies as usual and in your favour: **propose an event by
  adding it to `mustRecord`.** The mac suite will go red until this side
  records it — that is the mechanism working, not damage — so name the case in
  "Contract cases waiting on the mac" above and it reads as a request. The
  reasoning, the storage locations and what must never be recorded are in
  `WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md` under "Problem reports"; `CLAUDE.md` rule 5 is the short
  version.

- **A divergence was reported TO Windows, not from them** (mac sweep,
  2026-08-16). The first-deploy marker: this side reads the marker for the
  course's CURRENT destination, `AssistWorkspace.cs` accepts either folder.
  Written up in `WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`. Nothing to do here — the mac's behaviour
  is the correct one — but if they answer with a reason for their version,
  that answer belongs in `contracts/file-formats.json` beside the rule.



Things to KNOW rather than to do. An item here that grows an ask should move
up to **Open** instead of hiding a to-do in a list nobody reads for work — which
is what happened to the test-race item, sitting here for three days with
"worth ten minutes to check" in the middle of it.


- **Windows marketing screenshots & platform-conditional serving on plantoir.app** (Windows, 2026-08-17).
  The Windows side implemented autonomous screenshot capture in `MarketingShotCapturer.cs` (`Plantoir.exe --capture-marketing-shots <dir>`) and `website/shots/capture_windows.py`.
  The 5 app-window marketing shots (`courses`, `new-course`, `progress`, `preview`, `assistant`) are captured in Light and Dark mode at 2x HiDPI resolution, optimized with WebP companions into `site/img/`.
  In `website/build.py`, `picture_element` outputs both Mac (`.shot-platform-mac`) and Windows (`.shot-platform-windows`) `<figure>` blocks when Windows variants exist.
  `website/layout/base.html` detects Windows visitors via an inline `<script>` in `<head>` and toggles CSS class `is-windows` so Windows visitors see native Windows WinUI 3 screenshots while macOS visitors continue seeing native macOS SwiftUI screenshots.


- **Cleanup that fails must not fail a test that passed** (Windows,
  2026-08-14, `0479d44`). An intermittent failure that never reproduced turned
  out to be 23 tests ending with a bare
  `finally { Directory.Delete(root, recursive: true); }`. On Windows that
  throws whenever anything still holds a handle in the folder — Defender
  scanning the files the test just wrote, or the Search Indexer. Every
  assertion had passed; the test failed on housekeeping. If the mac's tests
  do the same on a machine with Spotlight indexing, the same shape is
  available. Deleting a temp folder is housekeeping: when it does not work,
  the OS will get to it.


- **The MCP proposal's Phase 0 question is settled** (asked 2026-08-12,
  answered 2026-08-15). The design for letting AI assistants drive Plantoir
  over MCP — "publish the Science courses overnight and un-draft tomorrow's
  class plus everything it links to" — asked the mac side whether to ship
  **one** self-contained .NET binary serving both platforms, or reimplement
  the tool contract in Swift. Both halves are now code rather than a
  question: `windows-app/Plantoir.Mcp/` is built and on `main`, and the mac
  reimplemented the contract in `Models/Assist/AssistMCPServer.swift` — the
  app itself answers `--mcp-stdio <folder>` rather than shipping a second
  binary, off the same `AssistToolSurface` the assistant window uses, so the
  two clients cannot drift. The handshake is recorded in the entry above.
  (The proposal itself is now folded into `research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md`.)


- **The Windows icon derives from `mac-app/Plantoir.icon`** (2026-08-11).
  `windows-app/Plantoir/Assets/make-icon.ps1` turns a full-bleed 1024px
  Icon Composer export into the exe/.ico and About-panel assets, applying
  the macOS rounded-rect silhouette; `site/icon.png` on plantoir.app
  comes from the same export. If the icon art ever changes, tell the
  Windows side so those derived assets are regenerated — nothing updates
  them automatically.


- **Auto-update plans need appcast coordination** (2026-08-12). Windows
  will adopt WinSparkle (paired with an Inno Setup installer, planned
  after v1.0); if/when the mac app adopts Sparkle, BOTH appcasts should
  live on plantoir.app in this repo's `site/` — use per-platform file
  names from the start (`appcast-windows.xml`, `appcast-macos.xml`) so
  the two update feeds never collide, and add the release-time appcast
  edit to the shared checklist in `RELEASING.md` when the
  first one lands.


- **The mac release asset must be named exactly `Plantoir-macOS.zip`**
  (2026-08-11; SPECCED — the mac ships a zip, not a dmg: Safari
  auto-unzips, average users fumble the dmg ritual, and Sparkle handles
  zips natively). plantoir.app now lives in `site/` in this repo
  (Netlify deploys it on push) and its download cards link straight to
  `releases/latest/download/<asset-name>` — GitHub's evergreen URL that
  only works while every release names its assets identically. Windows
  ships `Plantoir-win-x64.zip`; the mac card expects
  `Plantoir-macOS.zip`. The names are frozen: renaming an asset silently
  breaks the site's download button.


- **The release process is shared — read `RELEASING.md`**
  (2026-08-11). The decisions that bind both sides: ONE product version
  series in lockstep (Windows reads `<Version>` in `Plantoir.csproj`;
  keep the mac marketing version matching), ONE GitHub release per
  version carrying BOTH platforms' assets (plantoir.app's download cards
  point at `releases/latest`), tag `v<version>`. Release notes are
  drafted by Claude via the `cut-release` skill
  (`.claude/skills/cut-release/`) — teacher-friendly bullets from the
  commit log plus a SHA-256 downloads table; the mac asset should be
  attached to the same release and hashed into the same table. (The
  `.claude/skills/example-content/` skill has since arrived — the mac
  side un-ignored `.claude/skills/` and committed it.)


- **Course-catalog repairs** (`37dc6c8`): MTH1W read "Mathematics,
  Grade 9, Grade 9, Destreamed" (short name "Math,") and PLF4M had the
  same doubled-grade + trailing-comma pattern; both repaired in
  `support/ontario_secondary_courses.json`. The mac app picks this up by
  rebuilding (bundled support folder). No other entries matched either
  pattern.


- **Toolchain hash changed** (`94e25f8`): `scripts/deploy.py` changed,
  so the next preview/deploy on any machine rebuilds the Docker image
  once.


- **Windows caught up with rows 91–96** (`e7076ae`): Starting Content
  toggles, structure lock, LCS terminology switch, and the neutral
  factory defaults are now mirrored on Windows (including the
  `WizardDefaults` pairing and a Windows `ExampleContentCatalog`).
  Nothing to do on mac — listed so the mac side knows the wizards agree
  and that changes to `DEFAULT_*`/`LCS_*` in `scripts/setup_course.py`
  must now be mirrored in BOTH apps' `WizardDefaults`.


## Done — the ledger

Kept in full, newest first. A finished entry is not deleted: the mac does what
it does BECAUSE of these, and the `✅ DONE` line names what landed here and
where.

- **Windows app brought into full parity with shared contracts and macOS features**
  (Windows, 2026-08-17, branch `windows-sync`). All 457 tests pass on Windows
  (`dotnet test Plantoir.Tests/Plantoir.Tests.csproj`, 0 failures).
  
  **✅ DONE (Windows, 2026-08-17).**
  1. **All contracts wired and tested in `Plantoir.Tests`**:
     - `AssistCasesContractTests.cs`: runs all `assist-cases.json` scenarios, near misses, and prompt history.
     - `ClassPlanningContractTests.cs`: runs all `class-planning.json` cases (Unit X, Day Y regex parsing, title numbers, next class planner, class insertion renumbering and link rewrites).
     - `ScheduleRulesContractTests.cs`: runs all `schedule-rules.json` cases (Google Sheets CSV URLs, date columns, relative days, ambiguous slash dates).
     - `ContractTests.cs`: runs `app-rules.json`, `assist-wording.json`, `course-management.json`, `file-formats.json`, and `shared-rules.json` (activity trail, model jargon sweeps, curriculum rules, assistant model choice, problem reports, and credential prompts).
  2. **Assistant Choice & Settings Panel (`AssistantSettingsDialog`)**:
     - "Before it changes your pages" toggle + small assistant caution.
     - "Which assistant runs on this PC" (automatic, smaller, larger) with hardware budget memory derivation and cautions.
     - "On this PC" housekeeping list with download status, download trigger, and safe model removal (disabled when any assistant window is open).
     - Connected to `AppSettings` and `MainWindow` menu (`File -> Settings…` / `Ctrl+,`).
  3. **Curriculum Rules (`CurriculumRules.cs`)**:
     - Implemented `IsCurriculumPage`, `IsExpectationCode`, and `ExpectationWording` (with anchor stripping).
  4. **Credentials & Token Dialogs (`CredentialRequests.cs`)**:
     - Rich credential dialogs in `TaskProgressView` for Netlify token, Cloudflare token, and Cloudflare Account ID with numbered steps, token links, and PasswordBox/TextBox without auto-opening tabs.
     - "Where do I find this?" link button in `PublishingChoiceView` opening Cloudflare Account ID help dialog.
  5. **Thinking Flags**:
     - `--reasoning off` and `--reasoning-budget 0` passed to `LocalModel.cs`.
  6. **23 MCP Tools**:
     - Implemented and exposed in `PlantoirTools.cs` / `plantoir-mcp.exe`.

- **The local assistant went from built to trustworthy in one live-tested
  day — read `research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md` part 2 §10 before building the mac's**
  (Windows + shared, 2026-08-14, the `ai-assist` branch from `7b18fe6` to
  `1961d07`). The short of it: everything measured, five design decisions
  worth inheriting rather than rediscovering, and the conversation loop is
  now **shared C# in `Plantoir.Core`** — port the window, not the logic.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15) — read, and mostly inherited.** The design
  decisions were taken across whole: coarse tools, plan_ twins, publish and
  unpublish as separate verbs, nothing destructive, the gate reading the
  server, the card phrasings matched in code, the date APPENDED. Two things
  are deliberately different. **The cache save/restore was not ported** —
  it exists to avoid a 175-second cold read, and natively that read is 2.1
  seconds, so the machinery would be pure failure surface; a background
  warm-up on window open replaces it in a dozen lines. And **there is no 3B
  rung**: measured here, it inverts polarity. See spec entry 144.

  1. **The loop is `Plantoir.Core/Assist/AssistAgent.cs`**, behind
     `IChatModel` (the llama.cpp client) and `IToolServer` (the MCP stdio
     client). The mac app supplies those two and a window; every behaviour
     below comes with the class, already pinned by
     `Plantoir.Tests/AssistAgentTests.cs`, which runs the whole promise
     card in two seconds.
  2. **The promise card's eleven phrasings are COMMANDS, not routing
     questions** (`CardCommand`). Measured word for word, the model
     misrouted five of eleven — every trial — while filling arguments
     perfectly (87 trials, zero wrong courses/dates/types). Fixed shapes
     are matched in code; the model keeps whatever has a story in it.
  3. **Only deploys wait for a button.** Everything else is backed up,
     undoable, and invisible to students until a deploy; a scheduled
     deploy collects its yes at scheduling time. The plan-first system
     prompt is gone (it made undo over-salient — see §10.4's regressions
     before re-wording anything).
  4. **The assistant automates the app, it does not duplicate it.**
     `rebuild_preview`/`deploy_section` never reach the server from the
     window — they press the app's own Preview/Deploy. Page edits run
     with `preview: false` and do what a person would: stop the showing
     preview, edit, OFFER the restart. This matters because the served
     preview is a merged COPY — an edit is invisible to it until rebuilt,
     which on Windows read as "the assistant is stuck".
  5. **The prompt cache is real and once-ever, if you name it honestly**:
     save/restore verified (175 s cold → 30 ms restore → 11.7 s turn),
     file named per course + section + SHA-fingerprint of system prompt
     AND narrowed schemas, empty saves deleted, "Ready"/"picking up"
     only said when true. Reference: `LocalModel.cs` (the WSL parts are
     Windows-only; the colima analogue of "who holds the VM open" is
     yours to check).

  Smaller but shared: MCP progress only flows if the client sends
  `_meta.progressToken` (see `McpClient.Call`) — without it every
  milestone line is silently dropped; `AssistWorkspace.Apply` now narrates
  page-by-page ("Editing “Unit 2, Day 3”…"), which the window grows into
  one work-log bubble; the dateline rides appended on every user turn
  (prepended cost 15 routing points; in the system prompt it would break
  the cache nightly); `NarrowToLocal` rewrites the schemas' example
  course to the window's own, because the model copies examples; and the
  transcript speaks with ONE name, never shows content that rides with a
  tool call, and never shows the dateline.


- **⚠️ Add Section was creating pages in the OLD schema — check yours**
  (Windows, 2026-08-14, `7a66200`). The publish/draft entry below was landed
  and then found INCOMPLETE: `SectionAdder`'s fallback template — the path
  taken when there is no sibling section to copy — was still writing
  `draft: true`. A section added through the app was therefore born in the
  schema everything else had moved off.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-14, `b2a4c0bf`).** Fixed, and the mac had the
  same bug in a second place Windows had not hit: `SectionAdder` also
  COPIED `draftSectionN` from the sibling section, so a course installed
  from a migrated payload would have found no key and published a page the
  teacher had held back. `publishValue(forSection:in:)` now reads either
  key and inverts the legacy one, and
  `testALegacyDraftSectionKeyIsReadAndInverted` pins the inversion.

  It was missed because the TEST agreed with the code: it asserted
  `draft: true` and passed. Worth ten minutes on the mac's own section
  scaffolding for exactly that reason. Two rules: write `publish:` inverted
  (a teacher-eyes-only page is `publish: false`), and only in the FALLBACK —
  when a sibling section exists its frontmatter is copied verbatim, which is
  right, because a course still using `draft:` should get a new section that
  matches its siblings rather than one page speaking a different language.


- **A section remembers when its classes meet** (shared, 2026-08-14,
  `9fa510c`). `courses/<CODE>/.internal/timetable/section<N>.json` holds the
  dates, where they came from in the teacher's words, and when recorded.
  Written when a re-date is applied, and by a new `remember_timetable` tool.

  **Format first, as with `WorkLease`** — the mac should read and write the
  same file rather than the same code:

  ```json
  { "section": 1,
    "dates": ["2026-09-08", "2026-09-10"],
    "source": "timetable.xlsx, block H",
    "recorded": "2026-08-14" }
  ```

  Inside the course, under `.internal/`, so it travels through backup,
  archive and restore — all of which are already careful about that folder. A
  file kept beside the app would come adrift the first time a teacher moved
  their work and be silently WRONG rather than missing. A partial list is
  refused rather than half-stored: a half-remembered timetable gets trusted
  and then dates the wrong classes.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15)** — `Models/SectionTimetable.swift` reads and
  writes that exact file, the path built from the course directory rather
  than from anywhere beside the app, and the partial list is refused whole
  with nothing written. The three tools (`read_remembered_timetable`,
  `plan_remember_timetable`, `remember_timetable`) are dispatched in
  `Models/Assist/AssistToolRunner.swift`; pinned by
  `Tests/QuartzTeachersTests/SectionTimetableTests.swift`. Spec entry 145.


- **Four new operations, all shared C# in `Plantoir.Core`** (Windows +
  shared, 2026-08-14). Nothing mac-specific except the UI that reaches them;
  the mac inherits the logic if it ports `AssistWorkspace`.

  - **Placeholder class pages** (`638d5d7`) — "add seven days to the next
    unit". Lands on the section's own meeting dates, skipping days an
    existing class already sits on, so a reshuffled course still gets the
    right answer. Pages start `publish: false`. Never overwrites, checked
    twice: at plan time and again at write time, because Obsidian is open in
    the other window. **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15)** —
    `Models/PlaceholderClassPlanner.swift`, landing on the section's
    remembered meeting dates and skipping days already taken, pinned by
    `Tests/QuartzTeachersTests/ClassPlanningTests.swift`.
  - **Insert a class and push the rest back** (`b913f85`) — the one a teacher
    called "a huge hassle". Later days of the SAME unit are renamed; every
    class after the insertion point, later units included, moves to a later
    meeting day and keeps its name. Renames run **highest day first** or they
    overwrite a real lesson. Titles inside the files follow the file names.
    **Links are rewritten by us, not by Obsidian** — Obsidian only does that
    when Obsidian performs the rename; a rename on disk from another process
    reads to it as a delete plus a create. All wikilink forms are handled
    (`[[P]]`, `[[P|alias]]`, `![[P]]`, `[[P#Heading]]`, `[[P#^block]]`);
    Markdown-style links are NOT, and that is written down rather than
    discovered. **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15)** —
    `Models/ClassInsertionPlanner.swift` with `Models/WikiLinkRewriter.swift`
    for the five wikilink forms, renaming highest day first, same
    `ClassPlanningTests.swift`.
  - **Curriculum expectations for a page** (`e5a01ed`) — the tools find the
    expectations and read out their full wording; the MODEL decides which fit,
    because that is a judgement about meaning. Transclusions go inside the
    `%%curriculum-start%%` markers, or a course installed without curriculum
    would keep a dangling reference on a live site. **✅ DONE (macOS)** —
    `Models/Assist/AssistCurriculumMentions.swift`, served on the **MCP
    surface only**. The local surface is a MEASUREMENT — routing accuracy was
    counted against exactly the tools a teacher asks for, fifteen of them at
    the time — so the curriculum tools are never added to it. Counted
    2026-08-15: `AssistToolSurface` defines **twenty** tools;
    `AssistToolRunner.definitions` narrows to the **thirteen** the local model
    is shown (the six `plan_` twins are called in code, and
    `remember_timetable` is withheld because a date the model invents silently
    schedules the wrong day); and `AssistToolRunner.mcpTools` is the
    **twenty-three** `AssistMCPServer` serves — the twenty plus three
    MCP-only curriculum tools. The numbers move when something is measured
    again, not casually.
    A page with no markers gets the whole block in the payload shape —
    `%%curriculum-start%%`, `## Curriculum connection`, blank-line separated
    `![[A1.2]]`, `%%curriculum-end%%` — placed before the things-to-do list
    when there is one.
  - **Scheduled deploys** (`935ad9f`, `ad020d3`, `4400f80`) — see the next
    entry; the Windows half is `schtasks`.


- **Scheduled deploys — the mac needs launchd** (Windows, 2026-08-14). "Deploy
  tomorrow's class at 6:30 AM." Windows uses `schtasks` to run
  `deploy.ps1 <CODE> <N>` at a set time; the mac equivalent is a launchd
  agent running `deploy.sh`. The decision of *whether* to schedule, and every
  word the teacher reads, is already in `Plantoir.Core`
  (`ScheduledDeploy.Problem`) — only the last step is platform-specific.

  Points that cost something to learn:

  - **It must fire with nothing of ours running.** Verified: a task fired
    unattended, started WSL from cold, reached Docker, with Plantoir closed.
    The teacher's *Go ahead* consents to setting the alarm, not to the deploy.
  - **No wake timer, deliberately.** Waking depends on hardware and power
    settings and fails SILENTLY; the plan states the conditions instead (on,
    awake, plugged in, lid open). A warning a teacher can act on beats a
    promise that might not be kept.
  - **Refuse what would ASK a question.** A Cloudflare course (needs the
    account ID only the app has) and a section never deployed (`deploy.py`
    asks what to name the site) are both declined AT SCHEDULING TIME.
    Attended, those fail in front of the teacher; scheduled, they wait on a
    prompt at half six with nobody there.
  - **One per section, by construction** — the task name is fixed per section,
    so scheduling replaces. Verified: scheduled twice, still one task.
  - **Visible, or it may as well not exist.** A clock sits beside the section
    in the sidebar with the time in its tooltip, and the context menu offers
    "Schedule Deploy…" or "Cancel Deploy at 6:30 AM…" — one or the other,
    never a greyed-out line teaching teachers to stop reading the menu.
    **Ask the OS, do not keep a note**: the teacher can delete the task
    themselves, and a badge promising a deploy that will never happen is worse
    than no badge.

  **✅ DONE (macOS).** `Models/ScheduledDeploy.swift` writes a launchd user
  agent into `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, loaded with `launchctl bootstrap
  gui/<uid>` and removed with `bootout` — not the deprecated `load`/`unload`.
  Label is `ca.russellgordon.Plantoir.deploy.<CODE>.section<N>`, so two
  sections cannot collide and scheduling replaces rather than stacks. The
  plan/apply pair is `plan` (changes nothing) and
  `scheduleDeploy`/`cancelScheduledDeploy`. Sidebar clock, tooltip and the
  either/or menu item are in `SidebarView`; the picker is
  `Views/Section/ScheduleDeploySheet.swift`.

  Four places the mac differs, deliberately:

  - **No zombie agent.** `StartCalendarInterval` has no year, so a fired
    agent would come round again in twelve months. The job removes its own
    plist FIRST (a Mac restarting mid-deploy comes back with nothing
    pending) and `bootout`s itself LAST. `nextRun` also ignores an agent
    whose moment has passed.
  - **Cloudflare IS schedulable here.** The refusal on Windows is an
    argument-passing limit, not a policy: the plist carries `--account`, so
    the question is asked in the app and answered once. It is still refused
    when the Account ID is missing.
  - **launchd does NOT silently skip a missed job** — it runs it at the next
    wake. So the plan says that, rather than Windows's "nothing happens".
  - **The agent runs `deploy.sh` only**, as on Windows, so what goes out is
    the site as it was last BUILT. The plan says so and asks the teacher to
    preview again after later edits.

    **Superseded (macOS, 2026-08-15) — it builds first now.** The agent
    writes the staleness test (`BuildFreshness.needsRebuild`) out in shell,
    because the app is closed when the alarm fires and cannot be asked, then
    runs `preview.sh <CODE> <N> --build-only` and only then `deploy.sh`
    (`Models/ScheduledDeploy.swift`). This was not a nicety: `deploy.sh`
    never builds and **refuses outright when there is no built site**, so an
    agent running it alone either failed at half six or sent whatever was
    last previewed. **Windows should mirror this** — its `schtasks` job has
    the same gap. Spec entry 146.

  Pinned by `Tests/QuartzTeachersTests/ScheduledDeployTests.swift` (23 tests),
  which never touches the real launchd: the agents folder is redirected to a
  temporary one and `launchctl` is behind `LaunchControlRunning`. **Still
  wanted: one live run** — schedule a section a few minutes out, quit
  Plantoir, and check the site and `~/Library/Logs/Plantoir/<label>.log`.


- **The built-in assistant, and what it cost** (Windows, 2026-08-14). A local
  model in a window of its own, reached from "Revise with AI…" on both the
  course and every section menu. **Read
  [`research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md`](research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md) part 2 before building the mac
  equivalent** — it is the full account of what worked and what did not, with
  the measurements. The headlines that will bite whoever ports it:

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15).** Built as `AssistWindowView` +
  `AssistSession` + `AssistAgent`, reached from "Revise with Local AI
  Assistant…" on a
  section's context menu, one window per section. The engine is native
  llama.cpp with Metal rather than a container — 175 s → 2.1 s on the same
  model and prompt. Model tier chosen from the Mac's memory.

  - **Fewer tools is better routing AND a shorter prompt.** 34 tools is 9,032
    tokens; at ~21 tokens/second on two cores that is 430 seconds of reading
    before a first answer. The local model sees 15.
  - **A warm-up must prime the SAME prefix a real turn uses**, system message
    included, or it caches something no conversation asks for. Measured: 1.8s
    versus 29.6s for the identical turn.
  - **Colima may or may not idle out the way WSL2 does.** On Windows a
    detached container dies ~25 seconds after nothing holds the distro open,
    and the app now holds a session open for the conversation's life. Whether
    Colima behaves the same is **unknown and worth checking early** — the
    symptom is an HTTP error that looks like a network fault and is not.
  - **Withholding a tool is not a safety mechanism.** Deploy was trimmed out
    for speed and silently removed a capability the teacher had asked for by
    name. The approval gate — every non-read-only tool waits for a button,
    decided from the server's own `readOnlyHint` — is the safety mechanism.


- **The MCP server must SHIP with the app** (Windows, 2026-08-14, `b211b13`).
  `publish.ps1` never built `Plantoir.Mcp`, so the bundle contained no
  `plantoir-mcp.exe` and the whole feature would have shipped dead — on a
  teacher's machine only. It is now built, copied beside the app and signed
  with it. Keep them separate binaries: Claude Code launches the server
  itself as a stdio subprocess, so it has to stay a plain console app.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15) — and cannot recur here.** This is exactly
  why the macOS server is the app rather than a second binary: there is no
  packaging step that can forget to build it, and it is signed with the app
  because it IS the app. Worth considering on Windows if `plantoir-mcp.exe`
  ever goes missing from a bundle again.


- **The publication flag is `publish:`, not `draft:`** (Windows +
  shared, 2026-08-13, `ai-assist` branch). Commits `2d6c59a` (the
  toolchain and the app) and `7347d2b` (the example content and the
  course-creation wizard). Same caveat as the AI Assist entry below:
  **this lives on `ai-assist`, not `main`, and is not in 1.0.**

  > **Branch note, verified 2026-08-14 (macOS side):** `ai-assist` is now an
  > ANCESTOR of `origin/main` — `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/ai-assist
  > origin/main` succeeds, and `Plantoir.Mcp` and the assist documents (now merged into
  > `research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md`) are all present on `main`. The "not on `main`" caveats
  > below were true when written and are not any more; nothing needs merging
  > to reach this work.

  **✅ DONE (macOS + shared, 2026-08-14, `b2a4c0bf`).** Completed across the
  shared content the Windows change had not reached: 5,968 payload pages,
  108 EXC2O course-level pages, 1,944 skeletons, and the skeleton generator
  so a regeneration cannot reintroduce the old key. Two further defects
  came out of it — `per_section_frontmatter` left 493 shared pages UNSPLIT
  because it matched only `created`/`draft`, and the coverage map's own
  `_is_draft()` counted a `publish: false` page as published. The payload
  linter now rejects `draft:` outright. See spec entry 141.

  A page inside `section<N>/` now carries `publish:`; a course-level page
  carries `publishForSection<N>:`. Both are the OPPOSITE polarity from
  the keys they replace — `draft: true` becomes `publish: false`.

  **The shared half is done and the mac inherits it**, so read this
  before assuming the mac has to do anything drastic:

  - `build_site.py` maps `publishForSection<N>` → `publish` for the
    section being built, falls back to the legacy `draftSection<N>` /
    `draft` **inverted**, and strips all four key families from the
    built copy. A course nobody has touched builds exactly as it did.
  - `patches/publish.ts` gives Quartz a `PublishFlag` filter, and
    `build_site.py` rewrites `Plugin.RemoveDrafts()` to `Plugin.PublishFlag()`
    in `quartz.config.ts`. **Do not reach for Quartz's own
    `ExplicitPublish` instead** — it looks like exactly what we want and
    it is a trap. It reads `publish === true`, which flips the DEFAULT,
    and 60 of the sample course's 225 pages carry no flag at all,
    every curriculum page among them. All of them would have vanished
    silently. `PublishFlag` is eight lines that keep the forgiving
    default and change only the word.
  - `setup_course.py` creates new courses in the new schema.

  **What the mac app owes**: the same reading and writing of the new
  keys, in whatever its counterpart to `PageFrontmatter` is. Three rules
  matter, and each one is there because breaking it caused a real bug:

  1. **Read new-then-legacy, and invert the legacy value.** Per-section
     key first, plain key second, then `draftSection<N>`, then `draft`.
     No key at all means PUBLISHED.
  2. **Never write a legacy key.** Writing the new key is the migration,
     and it happens one page at a time as things are edited. There is no
     sweep and no flag day.
  3. **Write the new key in the OLD key's position**, so a migrated page
     shows a one-line diff instead of reordered frontmatter in a file
     Obsidian may have open.

  Watch for the inversion bug, because it is subtle and it bit three
  times here: any variable meaning "is this page hidden" must not be
  fed the raw `publish` value. All three instances were caught by tests
  that already existed — a plan that thought published pages still
  needed publishing, a dangling-link check that found nothing in either
  direction, and a transition line that told the teacher the exact
  reverse of the truth. Reference: `PageFrontmatter.IsDraft` /
  `StoredDraft` / `SetDraft` in
  `windows-app/Plantoir.Core/Models/PageFrontmatter.cs`.

  The example content in `support/` was inverted wholesale (1145 keys
  across 957 files), including the prose that teaches the flag, so the
  mac gets that for free. Verified against a real container build: a
  course with a page for every branch — `publish` true/false/absent/
  quoted-false, legacy `draft` both ways, and per-section keys set
  OPPOSITE for two sections — built correctly in all fourteen cases,
  with section 2's site the exact mirror of section 1's.


- **"Deploy" comes back to the GUI — this REVERSES row 103** (Windows,
  2026-08-13, `ai-assist` branch, commit `ba4889c`). Row 103 had the mac
  drop "Deploy" as jargon and call the button "Publish". That has to be
  undone, and not because row 103 was wrong: it was right when there was
  only one act to name. There are two now. A page is **published** when
  students can see it in the built site (the `publish:` flag above, which
  the assistant changes); the whole site is **deployed** to Netlify,
  Cloudflare, or a folder (the teacher's own act, which the assistant
  never takes). One word for both makes "I published tomorrow's class"
  mean a flag to one party and a live site to the other.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15).** 24 strings across 14 files, following the
  same rule: the SITE is deployed, a PAGE is published. Internal names kept
  their spelling, including every automation id, so no launcher, config key
  or UI test moved. One judgement beyond the Windows sweep: the Netlify
  failure messages ("Try publishing again" after a failed deploy) were swept
  too, since that sentence is exactly the confusion being fixed — flagged
  here in case Windows wants to match. See spec entry 143.

  On Windows the sweep covered: the toolbar button and its tooltip, the
  No Preview Running invitation, the progress title, the Publishing
  settings group (now "Deploying") and its "Deploy to" picker, the
  Cloudflare and folder problem dialogs, the busy lines in
  `CourseActivity.BusyReason`, and the folder-copy completion note.
  **Internal names deliberately keep their spelling** — `deploy.ps1` /
  `deploy.sh`, `deploy_target`, `deploy_folder_path`, the `deployButton`
  automation id — so nothing in the launchers or the config format
  moves. Also worth copying: the assistant's plan says "Unpublish", not
  "Hide", since hide/unhide is not a teacher's word.


- **AI Assist — an MCP server, on the `ai-assist` branch** (Windows +
  shared, 2026-08-13). Commits `c6b1381` (the feasibility investigation
  and its evidence) and `b3b7fc0` (the server). **Nothing here is on
  `main`, and none of it is in 1.0** (see the branch note above — this is
  no longer accurate) — the branch exists so this can be
  folded into a later release or dropped without touching the impending
  release. Read [`research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md`](research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md) part 1 first for the measurements,
  then [`windows-app/Plantoir.Mcp/README.md`](windows-app/Plantoir.Mcp/README.md)
  for the tool surface and the reasoning behind its shape.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-15), by a different route.** Rather than a
  separate executable, the app itself answers `--mcp-stdio <folder>` and
  serves the same `AssistToolSurface` over JSON-RPC. Verified by handshake:
  `initialize` and `tools/list` return `runner.mcpDefinitions` whole, with
  their schemas and `readOnlyHint` annotations — 15 tools when this was first
  verified, 23 when re-counted 2026-08-15. Same surface, two clients, no drift possible
  — and see the note on the entry below for why this route was taken.

  **What exists.** `plantoir-mcp`, a stdio MCP server over one working
  folder, built on the official `ModelContextProtocol` 2.2.0 C# SDK. Eight
  tools: four read-only, two planning tools that change nothing, and two
  writes that back up first. Verified end to end over real JSON-RPC against
  the sample course — including a publish that flipped one section's
  per-section key while leaving the other section's untouched, with the
  backup written first. (Those keys were `draftSection<N>` at the time;
  they are `publishForSection<N>` now — see the publication-flag entry
  at the top of this file.)
  Plan logic is unit-tested against a fake launcher; the suite is at 200.

  **The mac side inherits most of it.** The platform-neutral logic lives in
  `Plantoir.Core` (`Assist/AssistWorkspace.cs`, `Assist/PublishPlan.cs`,
  `Models/PageFrontmatter.cs`, `Models/PagePaths.cs`, `Models/WikiLinks.cs`)
  and the launcher call is abstracted behind `ILauncherRunner`, which picks
  `deploy.ps1` or `deploy.sh` by platform. The csproj already lists
  `osx-arm64` and `osx-x64`. **In principle `dotnet publish -r osx-arm64`
  is the entire mac port.**

  **The Phase 0 question is still open, and it is yours.** Is the mac side
  willing to ship a .NET-published binary beside (or inside) the app? If
  yes, one implementation serves both platforms and every behaviour is
  written and tested once. If no, `Plantoir.Mcp/README.md` is the spec a
  Swift implementation should follow — but please keep the four safety
  rules exactly, because each one is a measured failure and not a
  preference:

  1. *No destructive tool exists.* The model declined "delete the Unit 1
     folder" because it had **no tool for it**, not from judgement.
  2. *Publish and hide are separate tools, never one tool with a boolean.*
     Asked to hide a page, the model called publish with "include linked"
     set — on some runs and not others.
  3. *Every named entity is validated against disk*, and a miss is a
     refusal naming what does exist. Asked to "clean up my course", naming
     no course, it invented `MCV4U`.
  4. *Every write backs the course up first and has a `plan_` twin that
     changes nothing.* Row 106 closing its own loop.

  **Two things the mac side should sanity-check**, because they were
  reasoned from shared code rather than tested on macOS: that
  `Path.GetRelativePath`-based containment behaves as expected on a
  case-insensitive-but-case-preserving APFS volume, and that the launcher
  runner's `/bin/sh` invocation of `deploy.sh` inherits the environment
  Colima needs.

  **A shared-launcher change rode along with this, and it is worth taking
  even if the mac passes on everything else.** `preview.sh` and `deploy.sh`
  used `docker exec -it` unconditionally. `-t` **refuses to start** when
  stdin is not a terminal, so any non-interactive run — a script, CI, an
  MCP server — died at that line, *after* several minutes of Docker build,
  saying only "the input device is not a TTY". (`verify.sh:69-75` has
  refused up front for this reason for ages; that guard is now
  unnecessary.) Both scripts now ask for a terminal only when there is one
  and run Python unbuffered when there is not, so progress still arrives
  line by line instead of in one lump. **The interactive path is
  byte-identical in behaviour**, so the mac GUI — which supplies a terminal
  through `PseudoTerminal.swift` — is unaffected. Verified on Windows end
  to end; the shell edit is the same two-line shape and wants a quick
  confirmation on macOS.

  **Known gap, shared design needed.** The server cannot see the GUI's
  in-flight previews or publishes and vice versa — `CourseActivity` and
  `PreviewLeases` are in-process on both platforms. Overnight this is moot;
  daytime overlap could corrupt a build. The v2 answer is a lease file
  under the working folder that both apps and the server honour, which
  **both sides would have to adopt**. Worth agreeing on the file shape
  before either side writes it.


- **Cloudflare Pages as a third publishing destination** (Windows +
  shared, 2026-08-12). Commits `0306c98` (container side), `4575647`
  (account fallback), `e6611cc` (Windows UI). **The shared half is
  already done and the mac inherits it** — `scripts/deploy.py` and the
  `Dockerfile` are common to both apps. The mac side needs two things:
  `deploy.sh`, and the GUI.

  **What already works, in shared code.** `deploy.py --target cloudflare`
  discovers the account, creates or reuses this section's Pages project,
  hands the built folder to wrangler, and prints `Live URL: https://…` —
  the label both apps' parsers already read, so no parser change was
  needed on either side. Per-section state lives in
  `courses/<CODE>/.cloudflare_sites/section<N>.json`, deliberately
  mirroring the existing `.netlify_sites/` marker.

  **Design decisions, and why — please keep these rather than re-deciding:**

  1. *Publishing rides on wrangler, not a reimplementation.* Cloudflare's
     direct-upload protocol is multi-stage and undocumented: BLAKE3 hashes
     computed over base64-of-contents plus the file extension, a
     short-lived upload JWT that can expire mid-upload on a large site,
     and batched asset uploads. Community write-ups exist, but a
     reimplementation would break teachers' publishing silently whenever
     Cloudflare changed it. wrangler is Cloudflare's own supported
     implementation and already handles those edges.
  2. *wrangler is pinned at 4.80.0 — and pinned BELOW 4.100 on purpose.*
     From 4.100 wrangler requires Node 22; the image ships Node 20 because
     that is what Quartz v4.5.0 is known-good against. Raising Node to
     chase a newer CLI would mean revalidating every teacher's site build.
     Install and `--version` were verified on `node:20-slim` before
     committing. **If you bump Node, revisit this pin — and revalidate
     Quartz first.**
  3. *A token scoped to Pages CANNOT list its own account.* This was
     found by testing a real token: `/user/tokens/verify` reports
     `active`, while `/accounts` returns success with an EMPTY list and
     `/memberships` returns 403. The first cut treated "no accounts" as
     "bad token" and would have sent teachers off to re-mint a perfectly
     good one. **Validity and account lookup are now separate questions**
     — validity against `/user/tokens/verify`, the account by discovery →
     remembered value → asking. Please do not collapse them again.
  4. *Because of (3), the account ID must be collected in the GUI.* The
     app publishes with nothing attached that can answer a console
     prompt, so the launcher's prompt is unreachable from the GUI. On
     Windows it is a field in the Publishing section, validated live (32
     hex characters) with Save/Create gated on it, and passed to the
     launcher as `--account`. It is stored in **app settings, not course
     settings**, because it identifies the teacher rather than the course
     — the same reasoning that puts the token in the OS keychain — so it
     is entered once and used by every course.
  5. *The 25 MB per-file cap is checked before anything uploads.*
     Cloudflare refuses larger files, and the failure otherwise surfaces
     from deep inside the upload as an unhelpful error. `deploy.py` lists
     the offending files by name and suggests compressing the video or
     publishing that section to Netlify, which allows larger files. This
     is the one real functional difference between the destinations and
     is worth saying plainly in the mac UI too.
  6. *Tokens are stored under separate keychain entries.* A teacher
     publishing some courses to Netlify and others to Cloudflare keeps
     both, and `--reset-token --target cloudflare` clears only the
     Cloudflare one (plus its remembered account).

  **What the mac side must write.** `deploy.sh` needs the `--target`
  and `--account` flags, its own keychain entry for the Cloudflare token
  (plus one for the remembered account ID), token validation against
  `/user/tokens/verify`, and the same env hand-off into the container:
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, with
  `--target cloudflare` passed to `deploy.py`. **`deploy.sh` was left
  deliberately untouched on the Windows side** — shipping an edit to a
  launcher that could not be tested here would be worse than shipping
  none. GUI-wise: the third picker option, the account field with live
  validation, the milestone list (never saying "Netlify" — pinned by a
  test on Windows), and a decline path if the account is missing.
  Reference: `windows-app/Plantoir/Views/PublishingChoiceView.cs`,
  `SectionDetailView.xaml.cs` (`Deploy_Click`),
  `Plantoir.Core/Scripting/TaskMilestones.cs`,
  `CourseConfiguration.CloudflareAccountProblem`.

  **Status: PUBLISHED END TO END and working** (Windows, 2026-08-12).
  MCV4U Section 1 from a real workspace went live at
  `mcv4u-s1-2026-gordon.pages.dev` (HTTP 200, correct Quartz title),
  driven from the app's Publish button, not a script. Observed:

  - First publish ~140 s including the one-off toolchain image rebuild;
    a second publish ~23 s, reusing the project rather than creating a
    second one (exactly one project in the account afterwards).
  - The progress bar tracked "Step 8 of 8" through the
    `BuildAndDeployToCloudflare` list, and the completion panel showed
    "Your website is live" with the clickable pages.dev link — the
    Netlify live-link panel works unchanged, because `deploy.py` prints
    the `Live URL:` label the parser already reads.
  - The marker file came out as intended:
    `{name, id, subdomain, account_id}`.

  **The build-counter question is settled, empirically.** The deployment
  record for a Direct Upload reports `deployment_trigger.type: ad_hoc`
  and its stages come back `clone_repo=idle, build=idle, deploy=success`
  — **no Cloudflare build runs**, so the free plan's 500-builds-per-month
  limit does not apply to how Plantoir publishes. A teacher republishing
  many times a day across several classes is in no danger of it. (The
  limit is documented as applying to builds triggered by a git push,
  which this path never does.) Worth not re-investigating on the mac.

  Remaining unknown: behaviour at the 25 MB per-file cap has still only
  been checked by the pre-flight guard in `deploy.py`, not by actually
  pushing an oversized file.

  **Mirror the standing size note too** (`8883ad9`). Whenever Cloudflare
  is the chosen destination, the Publishing section shows a permanent
  orange line — not the validation warning, which comes and goes, but a
  fact about the destination that never hides:

  > One thing to know: Cloudflare won't accept any single file larger
  > than 25 MB. Documents, images, and slide decks are almost always
  > comfortably under that — a long video usually isn't. Most teachers
  > embed video from YouTube or Vimeo rather than uploading it, which
  > avoids the limit entirely.

  This is the one real functional difference between the destinations, so
  a teacher should meet it while choosing rather than when a publish
  fails. The grey caption deliberately no longer repeats it.

  **✅ DONE (macOS).** Both halves the mac owed.

  `deploy.sh` gained `--target netlify|cloudflare` and `--account <ID>`,
  its own Keychain entries (`containerized-quartz-cloudflare` and
  `containerized-quartz-cloudflare-account`, separate from the Netlify one
  so a teacher keeps both), validity against `/user/tokens/verify` kept
  SEPARATE from the account lookup exactly as decision (3) asks, the
  account resolved `--account` → discovery → remembered → ask, and the same
  env hand-off into the container: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`,
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `--target cloudflare` to `deploy.py`.
  `--reset-token --target cloudflare` clears only the Cloudflare pair. The
  token now lands at `/tmp/deploy_pat` rather than `/tmp/netlify_pat`,
  since either token rides the same way.

  GUI: `PublishingChoiceView` is now a three-way picker (`netlify` /
  `cloudflare_pages` / `local_folder` — the same spellings Windows writes,
  since the file is shared), with the Account ID field, live 32-hex
  validation via `CourseConfiguration.cloudflareAccountProblem`, and the
  permanent orange 25 MB note. The ID is in `Models/AppSettings.swift`
  (app settings, not course settings), matching the Windows reasoning.
  Save and Create are gated on it; the Deploy button refuses BEFORE any
  building, with the same "under Deploying" wording. Milestones
  `deployToCloudflare` / `buildAndDeployToCloudflare` never say "Netlify",
  and the `Live URL:` parser needed no change, as promised.

  New: `Models/DeployCommand.swift` is now the single place that decides
  what `deploy.sh` is asked to do. Both the Deploy button and the scheduled
  agent read it, so a scheduled deploy cannot quietly go to the wrong
  destination.

  Pinned by `Tests/QuartzTeachersTests/CloudflareDeployTests.swift`.
  **Still wanted: one live Cloudflare deploy from the mac**, the way
  Windows verified MCV4U — nothing here has yet met a real token.


- **`sanitize_last_name` folds accents instead of dropping them**
  (shared, 2026-08-12, commit `0306c98`). Pre-existing bug in
  `scripts/deploy.py`, found while testing Cloudflare project naming: the
  function kept only `a-z`, so a teacher named **Côté** got `ct` in her
  site name and Müller got `mller`. In an Ontario staff list that is not
  an edge case. It now normalises (NFKD) and strips combining marks
  first, so Côté → `cote`. **This affected Netlify site names too**, and
  the mac inherits the fix automatically since `deploy.py` is shared —
  no mac code needed, but worth knowing the suggested names changed.
  Existing sites are pinned by their marker files and are unaffected.

  **✅ DONE (shared).** Already present in `scripts/deploy.py` on this side —
  arrived with the merge and verified: `Côté` → `cote`, not `ct`.


- **About box credits match plantoir.app's footer** (Windows, 2026-08-11).
  The credits section is now: a rounded-rect callout carrying the full
  sponsor message ("Plantoir is a friendly wrapper around [Quartz], which
  Jacky Zhao builds and gives away for free. If you end up using Plantoir
  regularly, please consider [sponsoring him on GitHub] — it is his work
  that makes all of this possible."), then three plain acknowledgement
  lines: "Icon from [Phosphor Icons] (MIT)." / "Designed by
  [Russell Gordon]." / "Made with Claude." — links to quartz.jzhao.xyz
  and github.com/sponsors/jackyzha0 (in the callout), phosphoricons.com,
  russellgordon.ca. No "Built on Quartz" line: the callout already says
  whose work this stands on. (Replaces the old one-line "Please sponsor
  Jacky" credit; plantoir.app's footer matches.) Also: the
  plantoir.app/support row is REMOVED from the Windows About — help is
  coming into the app itself — leaving Email as the only contact row;
  drop the mac About's Support row to match. Mirror in the mac About
  window. Reference: `windows-app/Plantoir/Views/AboutDialog.cs`.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-12).** Mirrored as spec entry 107.


- **Preview builds are never deploy-fresh** (from `94e25f8`, 2026-08-11).
  Deploying right after previewing published the preview's build, whose
  pages carry Quartz's live-reload client (`new WebSocket('ws://localhost:…')`)
  — so the PUBLISHED site knocked on every visitor's localhost and
  Chromium-family browsers prompted "wants to access other apps and
  services on this device" on first load. The shared `scripts/deploy.py`
  now detects the client and re-emits a production build before
  uploading, which already protects the mac app functionally — but the
  mac app's own deploy-freshness check shares the Windows one's blind
  spot (it compares only content dates). Mirror the Windows fix so the
  app's ordinary, visible build-first step runs instead of the silent
  in-deploy rebuild: a built `public/index.html` containing
  `ws://localhost:` is never fresh. Reference:
  `windows-app/Plantoir.Core/Models/BuildFreshness.cs`
  (`BuiltForPreview`) and the `APreviewBuildIsNeverDeployFresh` test in
  `windows-app/Plantoir.Tests/ModelTests.cs`.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-12).** Mirrored as spec entry 108.


- **Font samples show the course's own computed site title** (Windows,
  2026-08-11). The header font sample renders the title the build will
  actually produce — `[Grade X ]Name[, Section N]`, i.e. the course name
  with the grade and section-marker switches applied — in the candidate
  typeface, updating live as the name, code, section numbers, or either
  toggle changes. The "Grade 11 Computer Science" stand-in remains only
  while the form is blank; the body-sentence sample is unchanged. In
  Course Settings each section's sample uses that section's own toggles.
  The compute is `CourseConfiguration.ComputedSiteTitle` (Core),
  mirroring `computed_landing_title` in `scripts/build_site.py` and
  pinned by a six-case theory test. Mirror in the mac wizard's
  FontChoiceEditorView and Course Settings. References:
  `SampleHeaderText()` in `windows-app/Plantoir/Views/NewCourseDialog.cs`
  and `windows-app/Plantoir/Views/CourseSettingsView.xaml.cs`;
  `ComputedSiteTitleMatchesTheBuild` in
  `windows-app/Plantoir.Tests/CourseConfigurationTests.cs`.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-12).** Already on macOS as spec entry 100.


- **Explain a disabled Create button in the wizard** (from `2d10e4c`,
  2026-08-11). On Windows, a filled-in New Course form with a DUPLICATE
  course code left Create greyed with no explanation — the sections
  field explained its problems inline while the code field stayed
  silent. Windows now shows the reason under the code field ("A course
  named ICS4U already exists — choose a different code."), single-sourced
  with the check that gates the button. Worth checking whether the mac
  wizard has the same silent-disable and wants the same inline
  explanation. Reference: `CourseCodeProblem()` / `RefreshCodeValidation()`
  in `windows-app/Plantoir/Views/NewCourseDialog.cs`.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-12).** Mirrored as spec entry 109.

- (Earlier Windows work — About credits + Support-row removal, the
  preview-build deploy-freshness check, the computed-title font samples,
  and the live code-field explanation — was picked up on 2026-08-12;
  spec entries 107–109 record those mirrors.)


- **Worth checking: the same test race may exist on the mac**
  (`3bbb1a7`, 2026-08-13). A Windows test failed about one run in three
  with a baffling null. The cause was not the production code: preview
  leases and the publish registry are **process-wide statics**, the test
  runner runs test classes in parallel, and the lease-tests class reset
  that shared state around every one of its methods — wiping the lease
  another class was mid-assertion on. Fixed by putting both classes in a
  serialized collection. If the mac's tests around `CourseActivity` /
  preview leases share process-wide state and run in parallel, the same
  intermittent failure is possible there; it is the kind that gets
  written off as "flaky CI" for months. Worth ten minutes to check.

  **✅ DONE (macOS, 2026-08-16) — checked, and the mac is not exposed.** The
  test target is `parallelizable = "NO"` in the scheme, so XCTest runs these
  classes one at a time and the shared statics cannot be reset under another
  class mid-assertion. **The safety is a scheme setting, not a property of the
  tests**: `PreviewLeaseTests` and `CourseActivityTests` both call
  `PreviewLeases.reset()` / `CourseActivity.reset()` around individual methods,
  so turning parallel testing ON would introduce exactly the Windows failure —
  one run in three, a baffling null, and months of being written off as flaky.
  If that setting is ever flipped, put these classes in a serialised group
  first.

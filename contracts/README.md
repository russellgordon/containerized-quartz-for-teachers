# The Plantoir contract — what both apps must agree on

Six JSON files, **generated from the macOS app** and read by both test suites.
They exist so that "implement what changed on the mac" ends in a green Windows
suite instead of a day of clicking.

This began as the assistant's contract and is no longer only that: it now
covers what the launcher is asked to do, what a teacher is told about what they
typed, how their list of class dates is read, what the files a course keeps are
called, and how classes are named and renumbered. **The test is not which
feature a rule belongs to — it is whether the rule is the product's or the
platform's.** A sentence a teacher reads, an input with one right output, an
order events must happen in: shared. A window's layout, a container's
mechanics, a measurement taken on one machine: not.

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [`assist-wording.json`](assist-wording.json) | Every sentence the assistant says to a teacher about deploying, previewing and agreeing to things, with `{course}` and `{section}` where values go. |
| [`assist-cases.json`](assist-cases.json) | The assistant's behaviour: which phrasings are matched in code rather than routed, which tools wait for a button, what must happen in what ORDER when it deploys, and how the arrow keys walk the prompt history. |
| [`file-formats.json`](file-formats.json) | **The two files both apps WRITE and the Python then reads**: every `course_config.json` key with its type and default, and the frontmatter that decides whether students see a page — including the legacy `draft:` spelling, which means the opposite. |
| [`shared-rules.json`](shared-rules.json) | Four rule sets on top of machinery that could not be less alike: what a scheduled deploy refuses and in what order, what the sidebar's filter shows, what is stripped from the launchers' output, and what counts as a curriculum expectation. |
| [`course-management.json`](course-management.json) | The names the three kinds of zip carry and how they are told apart, what section number is offered next and which entries are refused in whose words, and the grade a course code names. |
| [`class-planning.json`](class-planning.json) | Which page titles carry numbers, what "the next class" would be called, and — the highest-stakes data here — the ORDER renames must run in when room is made for a class. |
| [`schedule-rules.json`](schedule-rules.json) | How a teacher's own list of class dates is read: every accepted date form, how an ambiguous `08/09/2026` column is settled or asked about, and what a pasted Google Sheet address becomes. |
| [`app-rules.json`](app-rules.json) | The app itself: what `deploy.sh` is asked to do for a given configuration, what a teacher is told about an Account ID or a custom domain they typed, how a failure's raw output becomes a sentence, whether a deploy must build first, the progress markers and **where each marker's text comes from**, and the preview's ports. |

## What is generated and what is written by hand

`assist-wording.json` is generated in full. `assist-cases.json` is mixed, and
the boundary is a TOP-LEVEL key — the file names them under `generated.keys`:

| Key | Comes from |
|---|---|
| `cardPhrasings` | `AssistCardCommand.fixedShapes` |
| `tools` | `AssistToolRunner.tools` / `.localTools` / `.mcpOnlyTools`, and each definition's `needsApproval` and `planTwinName` |
| `nearMisses`, `scenarios` | **Hand-written intent.** The generator preserves them; nothing in the code says what a near miss is, or what ORDER events must happen in — those are decisions, and decisions are why this repository has handoff documents. |

In `app-rules.json` the same split applies: `milestones` is a readout of
`TaskMilestones` and is overwritten; `deployArguments`, `configurationRules`,
`previewPorts` and `markerOrigins` are authored and preserved. The rule behind
the split is worth stating once — **a readout of the code cannot fail when the
code changes**, so anything that must catch a regression is written by hand and
executed against the real function.

### The one in `app-rules.json` that is easiest to get wrong

`markerOrigins` says, for every progress marker, where its text actually comes
from. It decides whether your app must match the string exactly:

- **`shared-python`** — printed by `scripts/*.py`, identical output on both
  platforms. Match it to the character. Seventeen of the twenty-five are these.
- **`launcher`** — printed by `setup.sh` / `preview.sh` / `deploy.sh`, which
  have separately written `.ps1` counterparts. These **deliberately differ**:
  the mac watches for "Setting up this Mac" and Windows for "Setting up this
  PC". Seven of the twenty-five.
- **`elsewhere`** — printed by the Docker build or a tool; check by hand.

A mac test verifies the classification against the actual files, so a marker
that moves from a launcher into shared Python (or the reverse) fails here
rather than silently changing what Windows should be matching. Getting this
wrong crashes nothing: the progress bar simply stops moving, which reads as a
slow build.

## Proposing a case from the Windows side

The generator runs on the **mac** — `Plantoir --write-contracts` — so Windows
cannot regenerate the derived halves. The AUTHORED halves are a different
matter and can be proposed from either side: `scenarios`, `nearMisses`,
`promptHistory`, and every case list in the other four files survive a mac
regeneration untouched.

So a behaviour invented on Windows can be written here as a case, and **the
mac suite will then fail until the mac implements it.** That is the mechanism
working rather than breaking. Verified by adding a case for a step the mac has
no support for: `AssistScenarioTests` failed naming the case and the missing
event, rather than passing quietly.

Two things make that failure read as a request instead of as damage:

- **Name the case so it is obviously a proposal** and say in
  [`MAC-HANDOFF.md`](../MAC-HANDOFF.md) that it is waiting — the ledger is
  where the mac side looks for work that arrived from Windows.
- **Do not touch the generated keys** (`cardPhrasings`, `tools`, `milestones`).
  Those are readouts of mac code; an edit there is overwritten on the next
  regeneration and the diff looks like vandalism.

## Regenerating

```bash
Plantoir --write-contracts contracts
```

The bundled binary writes both files from the app's own types — `AssistWording`,
`AssistCardCommand`, `AssistToolSurface`. `AssistContractTests` runs the same
generator in-process and fails when what is committed no longer matches, naming
that command. **So a changed sentence fails on the mac first**, in the same run
that changed it, and arrives on the Windows side as a diff in this folder
rather than as a bug report from a teacher.

## Why these are not in `support/`

`support/` is bundled into the app and mirrored into every teacher's working
folder as `.toolchain/`. Test data does not belong in a teacher's course folder,
and anything put there gets copied to every machine that runs a build.

## Reading them from the Windows suite

Both files are plain data — an xUnit `[Theory]` with a `MemberData` source that
deserialises the JSON is the whole integration. Nothing here is macOS-specific:
the sentences are the product's, and the sequences are the toolchain's.

The full list of what the contract cannot cover — and therefore what each side
still tests for itself — is in
[`WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`](../WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md), under "Do not re-derive the
assistant's tests". Two of them matter enough to repeat:

- **How the preview is stopped and started.** WSL2, ConPTY and the preview
  leases have real Windows mechanics; `assist-cases.json` says the ORDER the
  events must occur in, not how to make them happen.
- **Anything the model decides.** Routing accuracy is measured, not asserted —
  see [`research/README.md`](../research/README.md). A contract can say that
  "deploy now" never reaches the model; it cannot say what the model would do
  with a sentence it does reach.

## Coverage: every mac test file, and where it stands

No stone unturned — this table is the audit, and a file missing from it is a
gap nobody has looked at. Counts are test functions, taken 2026-08-16.

**Shared through a contract** (the Windows suite can run the same cases):

| Area | Contract | Mac tests it draws on |
|---|---|---|
| The assistant's sentences | `assist-wording.json` | AssistToolRunner, AssistAgent |
| Deploy/preview order, cards, cancels | `assist-cases.json` → `scenarios` | AssistToolRunner (49), AssistScenario |
| Card phrasings and near misses | `assist-cases.json` → `cardPhrasings` | AssistAgent (8) |
| Tool lists, approvals, plan twins | `assist-cases.json` → `tools` | AssistToolRunner |
| Arrow-key history | `assist-cases.json` → `promptHistory` | AssistPromptHistory (15) |
| Launcher arguments | `app-rules.json` → `deployArguments` | CloudflareDeploy (13) |
| Validation messages | `app-rules.json` → `configurationRules` | CourseConfiguration (10), CustomDomain (4) |
| Progress milestones and marker origins | `app-rules.json` → `milestones`, `markerOrigins` | TaskMilestone (12) |
| Failure explanations | `app-rules.json` → `failureExplanations` | FailureExplainer (8) |
| Whether a deploy must build first | `app-rules.json` → `buildFreshness` | BuildFreshness (6) |
| Preview ports and the websocket offset | `app-rules.json` → `previewPorts` | PreviewLease (7) |
| The browser-safe address | `app-rules.json` → `linkRules` | BrowserSafeURL (2) |
| `course_config.json` keys, types, defaults | `file-formats.json` → `courseConfigKeys` | CourseConfiguration (10) |
| Page visibility: `publish:`, legacy `draft:`, per-section keys | `file-formats.json` → `pageVisibility` | ~33 tests across the suite |
| Reading a teacher's date list | `schedule-rules.json` | SectionScheduleSource (23) |
| Scheduled-deploy refusals | `shared-rules.json` → `scheduledDeployRefusals` | ScheduledDeploy (23) |
| Sidebar filtering | `shared-rules.json` → `sidebarFilter` | CourseFilter (9) |
| Stripping the launchers' output | `shared-rules.json` → `transcriptStripping` | TranscriptBuilder (6) |
| What counts as a curriculum expectation | `shared-rules.json` → `curriculumRules` | AssistCurriculumMentions (11) |
| Backup, archive and wizard zip names | `course-management.json` → `zipNames` | BackupItem, ArchivedItem (18) |
| Adding a section: suggestion, refusals, wording | `course-management.json` → `sectionNumbers` | SectionAdder, SectionNumbersValidation (21) |
| Grade labels from a course code | `course-management.json` → `gradeLabels` | SectionAdder |
| Naming, numbering, making room | `class-planning.json` | ClassPlanning (13), NextClass (13) |

**Not shared, and why.** Each of these is a deliberate decision, not an
oversight:

| Area | Tests | Why it stays local |
|---|---|---|
| Windows, sheets, layout, hit areas, fonts, chat bubbles | ~71 | Platform look and feel. The mac's numbers were measured against Messages; matching them on WinUI would produce something that looks foreign. What must be TRUE of the assistant's window is in `WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`. |
| Script runner and preview stopper mechanics | 34 + 2 | ConPTY against a pseudo-terminal, WSL2 against Colima. The OUTPUT they parse is shared (see `markerOrigins`); the machinery is not. |
| Scheduled deploys: the MECHANISM | ~14 | launchd against Task Scheduler — nothing about writing a plist or a task ports. The **refusals** are now shared (`shared-rules.json`), which is the half that matters. |
| Model tiers, plan mode, activity | 30 | Measured on this hardware. See `research/`; a tier ladder measured on an M4 Pro says nothing about a teacher's laptop with integrated graphics. |
| Restoring and archiving the FILES | ~8 | The zip NAMES are shared (above); unzipping, replacing a course folder and reporting what came back is filesystem work with different failure modes on each platform. |
| Example content, skeletons, course names | 25 | Both apps read the SAME files under `support/`. The data is its own contract; run the same validity checks against it rather than copying expectations here. |
| Workspace initialisation, folder containers | 18 | Filesystem shapes that differ (`~/Library/Application Support` against `%LOCALAPPDATA%`). |
| Writing a new section's files | ~5 | The rules are shared (above); creating folders and extending each page's frontmatter is filesystem work. |
| Curriculum mention PLANS, section restore | ~13 | The plan's wording and the restore's file work are local; **what counts as a curriculum expectation** — the folder rule, the code shape, the anchor — is now shared (`shared-rules.json`), because `build_site.py` decides it and both apps must agree with the Python. |
| Console focus and scrolling | ~5 | Which pane has focus and when it scrolls is per-platform. Sidebar filtering and transcript stripping are now shared (`shared-rules.json`). |

## The rule this exists to enforce

A sentence a teacher reads is a specification. Kept in the Swift that says it,
the Swift test that pins it, `GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md` where it is specified and
`WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md` where Windows is told to copy it, it is four copies and
three of them were already drifting — the same deploy failure was told two ways
("that section's console" / "that section's window") depending only on which
function ran it. Now it is written once in `AssistWording`, and everything else
is generated from it or tested against it.

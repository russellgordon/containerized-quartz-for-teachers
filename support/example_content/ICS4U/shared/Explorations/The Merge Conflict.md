Today you are going to break something on purpose, in front of
everybody, and it is going to be fine.

Two people. One file. The same three lines. Both of you are right, both
of you commit, and then the two versions have to become one version.
The tool does not guess and it does not pick a winner. It stops, marks
the disagreement in the file, and hands it back to the humans — which
is the single most reassuring thing about version control and the thing
students most expect to be a disaster.

## The setup

Everyone starts from the same tiny file. It is the fee rule from the
music room program you met on the first day of this course.

```python
def fee_owing(days_out):
    if days_out <= 14:
        return 0.00
    return 0.25 * (days_out - 14)
```

Commit that, on a branch everyone shares. Then the two partners get
different instructions, and **do not show each other**.

- **Partner A** is told: the office wants the daily rate lowered to ten
  cents.
- **Partner B** is told: the treasurer wants the amount rounded to
  whole cents, because `0.7000000000000001` appeared on a printed
  notice last month.

Both changes are correct. Both changes are wanted. Both changes touch
the same line.

## What the tool says

Commit separately, then merge. This is what actually comes back:

```text
Auto-merging signout.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in signout.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

And this is what is now sitting in the file:

```text
def fee_owing(days_out):
    if days_out <= 14:
        return 0.00
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return 0.10 * (days_out - 14)
=======
    return round(0.25 * (days_out - 14), 2)
>>>>>>> rounding
```

Read those markers slowly, because they are not damage and they are not
an error message. They are a sentence:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD        everything below this line is what YOU had
=======             the divider
>>>>>>> rounding    everything above this line came from that branch
```

The file is not broken. It has been annotated. Nothing has been lost:
both versions are right there, and the history still contains both
commits.

## The task

**Job one — produce the conflict.** Both partners, deliberately.
Nobody is allowed to avoid it by waiting for the other person. Follow
the mechanics in [[Using Version Control]].

**Job two — read it before you touch it.** Write down, in one sentence
each: what did A change, what did B change, and what does the merged
line have to do to satisfy both? Do this on paper, with the markers
still in the file.

**Job three — resolve it.** Delete the markers, leave one correct line,
run the function on 9, 21, and 15 days, and commit the resolution with
a message that says what you decided and why.

**Job four — do it again, worse.** Now both partners rename the same
variable to different names, in the same commit as an unrelated change.
Resolve that one too. Then say which of the two conflicts was harder
and what made it harder — it is almost never the number of lines.

## The count

1. How many people's first instinct was to delete one side entirely?
   Which side, and why that one?
2. Did anybody's resolution lose a change that somebody wanted? How
   would you have found out if the room had not been watching?
3. Job four was worse. Was it worse because of the tool, or because of
   how the two of you decided to commit?
4. What would have prevented the conflict entirely — and is preventing
   it always the right goal?

## What tends to surface

The first thing the room notices is that the tool's refusal is a
courtesy. A version control system that silently picked a winner would
be far more dangerous than one that stops and asks. Being interrupted
is the feature.

The second is social rather than technical. Job four is harder because
of how the two partners worked, not because of anything the tool did:
big commits that mix a rename with a real change, and two people
editing the same function at the same time without saying so. The fix
for most conflicts happens in conversation on Monday, not in the file
on Friday — which is the argument of [[Working in a Team]].

The third is about honesty in the history. A resolution commit whose
message says "fix conflict" tells the next person nothing. A message
that says which two changes were combined, and what was decided, is a
note to a colleague who has not been hired yet.

## Where this goes next

The vocabulary is collected in [[Version Control]] and the mechanics in
[[Using Version Control]]. Reading a change the way a reviewer does is
the routine [[Read the Diff]], and doing it to a teammate's real work,
with a protocol, is [[The Code Review]].

Everything here is load-bearing for [[The Software Project]], where the
history *is* the evidence of who contributed what. And the question of
who owns a file that four people wrote together is
[[Whose Code Is It]].

> merge.

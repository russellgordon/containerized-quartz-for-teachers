Mr. Whitfield keeps a sticky note on the library desk: books promised
to somebody, and roughly when they should be back on the shelf. Sticky
notes fall off. This program keeps the same list in a file, so it is
still there tomorrow, next week, and after the computer is restarted.

## The program

```python
# Shelf-reminder list for Mr. Whitfield. The file holds TITLES and a
# number of days — never who borrowed what. That is a decision, taken
# with him, and it is written here so nobody "improves" it by adding
# names later.

FILE_NAME = "reminders.txt"


def add_reminder(title, days):
    with open(FILE_NAME, "a") as file:
        file.write(f"{title}|{days}\n")


def show_reminders():
    try:
        with open(FILE_NAME, "r") as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No reminders saved yet — this will be the first.")
        return

    print()
    print(f"Reminders on file ({len(lines)}):")
    for line in lines:
        title, days = line.strip().split("|")
        print(f"  {title} — back in {days} days")


show_reminders()
title = input("Title to add: ")
days = input("Back in how many days? ")
add_reminder(title, days)
show_reminders()
```

The second time it is run, with one reminder already saved:

```
Reminders on file (1):
  Fifteen Dogs — back in 14 days
Title to add: Birdie
Back in how many days? 7

Reminders on file (2):
  Fifteen Dogs — back in 14 days
  Birdie — back in 7 days
```

## How it works

`open` needs a mode. `"a"` **appends** — it adds to the end and creates
the file if it is not there, which is why nothing is ever lost when a
reminder is added. `"r"` **reads**. The `with` block closes the file
properly when it ends, even if something goes wrong inside it, and that
matters: data written to a file that is never closed can quietly fail
to arrive.

Each reminder is stored as one line, with `|` separating the two
fields, and `\n` ending it. Reading it back reverses those two
decisions exactly: `.strip()` removes the newline, and `.split("|")`
turns `Fifteen Dogs|14` into two strings that unpack straight into
`title` and `days`. A file format is a promise between the part that
writes and the part that reads, and here the promise is four
characters long.

The first run of any program like this hits a file that does not exist.
`FileNotFoundError` is not an edge case, it is a certainty, so
`show_reminders` catches it, says something a human can act on, and
`return`s early instead of pushing on with data it does not have.

`FILE_NAME` in capitals is the convention for a value that is not meant
to change while the program runs. It also means the file is named in
exactly one place — worth having when you decide the data belongs in a
different folder on the shared drive.

> [!warning] The one-letter mistake that deletes everything

## Change it

1. **One line.** Do the `"a"` to `"w"` experiment above deliberately,
   on a file you do not mind losing, then change it back. Seeing the
   damage once is worth more than being told about it twice.
2. **A few lines.** Add a count of reminders due within a week: loop
   over `lines`, split each one, and compare `int(days) <= 7`. With the
   two reminders above the answer is `1`.
3. **A real change.** Record *when* each reminder was added. Put
   `from datetime import date` at the top, and write three fields
   instead of two: `f"{title}|{days}|{date.today().isoformat()}\n"`.
   Then update the reading loop to unpack three values instead of two —
   and notice that every line saved by the old version now breaks it.
   Deciding what to do about old data is called migration, and it is a
   real part of maintaining software people use.

The ideas are in [[Files and Persistence]], the practice is in
[[Files Practice]], and the reason this file holds no names is worth
re-reading in [[Should It Exist]] before your own project stores its
first row.

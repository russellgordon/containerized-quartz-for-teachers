title: What This Site Can Do
publish: true
created: __CREATED__
enableToc: true
tags:
  - reference
---
This page exists for two audiences. Students: it shows why the notes look
the way they do. Teachers: it is a working reference for everything you
can put in a page, with the source visible in every example.

Everything below is written in **Markdown** — plain text with a few marks
of punctuation that mean something. If you can write a text message, you
can write this.

---

## Text that carries meaning

You get **bold**, *italic*, ~~struck through~~, and ==highlighted== text.
Highlighting is the one worth knowing: it draws the eye better than bold
when you want a single ==key term== to stand out in a paragraph.

**How that was made:**

```markdown
**bold**, *italic*, ~~struck through~~, ==highlighted==
```

Arrows written as `->` become proper arrows: estimate -> refine -> check.

Keyboard keys look like keys: press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to search.

---

## Mathematics (not used in this course — but here if you need it)

This course has no equations to typeset, so you will not meet these in
our pages. The site handles them anyway, which matters if you also teach
a course that needs them — inline like $E = mc^2$, or displayed:

$$
\text{average} = \frac{\text{sum of values}}{\text{number of values}}
$$

**How that was made:** single dollar signs keep it in the sentence,
double ones give it a line of its own.

---

## Code, coloured and exact

This is the feature a programming course lives on: runnable examples
with the spacing and quotation marks preserved, coloured by meaning:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
if len(name) > 0:
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
else:
    print("Hello, mysterious stranger.")
```

**How that was made:** three backticks and the language name, the code,
then three backticks to close it. Every page in
[[Programs/index|the Programs folder]] uses this.

---

## Headings, and the table of contents

Every `##` heading on a page becomes a link in **Navigate this page**,
over on the right — built automatically from the headings, so it can
never fall out of step with the page. Deeper headings nest underneath.

A short page reads better without a contents panel; one frontmatter line
(`enableToc: false`) turns it off. Every class page in
[[All Classes/index|All Classes]] does this — an agenda of six items does
not need navigating.

---

## Callouts

Callouts pull something out of the flow of the page, each kind with its
own colour and icon:

> [!note] Note
> Neutral information worth setting apart.

> [!tip] Tip
> A shortcut, a habit, or something that makes the work easier.

> [!important] Important
> The one thing to take away if you take away nothing else.

> [!warning] Warning
> Where people usually go wrong — the classic sign-error traps live in
> these boxes.

> [!question] Question
> Something to think about rather than something to know.

> [!abstract] At a glance
> Used at the top of task pages for format and timing.

**How that was made:** a blockquote with the kind named in brackets.

```markdown
> [!warning] Where people usually go wrong
> The text of the callout goes here.
```

### Foldable callouts

Add a `-` to start a callout collapsed. Every practice set in
[[Exercises/index|Exercises]] hides its worked answers this way — try
before you peek, but the peek is always there:

> [!success]- Worked answer (click to expand)
> The loop runs 4 times — `range(4)` stops *before* 4 — so the program
> prints 0, 1, 2, 3. If you predicted a 4, you have just met the most
> famous off-by-one in programming.

```markdown
> [!success]- Worked answer (click to expand)
> The hidden solution.
```

## Diagrams

Diagrams are **written, not drawn** — edited in seconds, never needing a
graphics program.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Plan"] --> B["Predict"]
    B --> C["Run"]
    C --> D{"Did it do that?"}
    D -->|yes| E["Extend it"]
    D -->|no| F["Debug"]
    F --> B
```

**How that was made:**

````markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Plan"] --> B["Predict"]
    B --> C["Run"]
    C --> D{"Did it do that?"}
    D -->|yes| E["Extend it"]
    D -->|no| F["Debug"]
    F --> B
```
````

Proportions draw themselves too:

```mermaid
pie title Where web traffic comes from
    "Phones" : 62
    "Laptops and desktops" : 36
    "Everything else" : 2
```

And history fits on a line:

```mermaid
timeline
    title Machines that changed everything
    1943 : Colossus : code-breaking, room-sized
    1971 : Intel 4004 : a computer on a chip
    1991 : The Web : pages that link to pages
    2007 : The smartphone : the computer in your pocket
```

## Tables

**How that was made:** rows of text separated by `|`, with a line of
dashes under the headings. Mathematics works inside cells, which matters
more than it sounds.

| Storage | Lives | Reaches you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local drive | On this machine | Only at this machine |
| Cloud | On someone else's machines | Anywhere you sign in |
| Version history | Alongside the file | Whenever you regret an edit |

---

## Checklists

**How that was made:** a list where each line starts with `- [ ]`, or
`- [x]` for one already done.

- [ ] Predicted the output before running
- [x] Variable names say what they hold
- [ ] Comments explain the why, not the what
- [ ] Someone else could run this from your instructions

On the site they are read-only — the boxes show what the page says, and
clicking one does nothing. Copied into your own notes, they are how
[[Writing Good Comments]] turns from advice into habit.

---

## Links between pages

This is what makes the site more than a pile of documents.

- A plain link: [[Computational Thinking]]
- A link with different words: [[Computational Thinking|breaking problems down]]
- A link to a section: [[Computational Thinking#Decomposition]]

**How that was made:** double square brackets.

```markdown
[[Computational Thinking]]
[[Computational Thinking|different words for the link]]
[[Computational Thinking#Decomposition]]
```

### Transclusion — one page inside another

**How that was made:** `![[Page name]]` — a link with an exclamation mark
in front of it.
%%curriculum-start%%
Here is a curriculum expectation, embedded live rather than copied:

![[C2.4]]

Change the source page and every page that embeds it updates. This is how
each task page shows the expectations it addresses without anyone
maintaining duplicates.
%%curriculum-end%%

### Backlinks

Scroll to the bottom of any page and you will find **Backlinks** — every
page that links *to* this one, gathered automatically. Open
[[Computational Thinking]] and its backlinks list every exploration and
practice set that leans on it. Nobody maintains that list.

---

## Hover previews

Hover over [[Debugging Step by Step]] without clicking. The page appears in a
small window. Checking one definition mid-problem does not cost you your
place.

---

## Footnotes

**How that was made:** `[^1]` where the marker goes, and a matching
`[^1]:` line anywhere in the page.

The word "bug" predates computers.[^1]

[^1]: Engineers called mechanical faults "bugs" in the 1800s — but in
    1947, Grace Hopper's team taped an actual moth into their logbook
    after it jammed a relay in the Harvard Mark II: "first actual case
    of bug being found".

---

## Tags

**How that was made:** a `tags` list in the frontmatter at the very top
of the page.

```yaml
---
tags:
  - concepts
  - unit-2
---
```

Every tag becomes a page listing everything filed under it.

---

## What you cannot see

Two things on this page are invisible in the browser:

1. **Comments.** Text wrapped in `%%` double percent marks `%%` never
   reaches the site. Useful for notes to yourself in a page you are
   still writing — tomorrow's hint, next year's fix.
2. **Holding a page back.** A page with `publish: false` in its frontmatter
   is left out when the site is built. Write next week's lesson today and
   publish it when you are ready. A page with no `publish` line is published,
   so forgetting it can never make your work vanish.

%% This sentence is a comment. If you can read it on the website, something is broken. %%

> [!tip] For teachers reading this
> With more than one section, per-section keys like `publishForSection1` and
> `publishForSection2` let one shared page be published to one class and held
> back from another — useful when your two sections sit a few days apart.

---

## The point of all this

None of it is decoration. Each feature removes a reason for a page to be
out of date:

| Feature | The problem it solves |
| --- | --- |
| Coloured code | Screenshots of code nobody can copy or run |
| Transclusion | The same text copied into six places, five stale |
| Backlinks | "Where did we use this again?" |
| Folded answers | Solutions that spoil the attempt |
| Holding a page back | Next week's lesson in a separate file somewhere |

Write it once, link to it everywhere.

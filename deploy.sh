🧰 Usage:
  ${SELF_CMD} <COURSE_CODE> <SECTION_NUMBER> [--target netlify|cloudflare] [--account <ACCOUNT_ID>] [--diagnose] [--team <TEAM_SLUG>] [--reset-token|--logout] [--image REF]

Examples:
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1 --diagnose
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1 --team my-org-slug
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1 --target cloudflare

Notes:
- Deploys from /teaching/courses/<COURSE>/.merged_output/section<SECTION> inside the container.
- You must build first (the static site goes to 'public/' in that section folder).
- --target chooses where the built site goes: netlify (the default) or cloudflare.
- With --to-folder <path>, the site is published to <path>/section<N> on THIS
  computer instead of Netlify — an incremental copy (only changed files move),
  for teachers who upload to their own web host (e.g. over SFTP).
- The Netlify Personal Access Token (PAT) is stored in the macOS Keychain and injected securely at runtime.
  Netlify and Cloudflare tokens live under separate Keychain entries, so keeping both is fine.
- A Cloudflare token needs one permission: Account - Cloudflare Pages - Edit.
  The account is discovered from the token when it can be; --account supplies it
  when it cannot (a token scoped only to Pages cannot list its own account).
- Use --reset-token (or --logout) to remove the saved PAT and re-link on next run;
  combine it with --target cloudflare to clear the Cloudflare one instead.
- --image REF publishes using a particular already-built image; normally the
  image is built locally from this folder's recipe when missing.
- If your course code ends with '0' (zero), you'll be prompted to correct it to 'O' for Open-level courses.

One more thing from Cloudflare.

The token you just made is allowed to publish, but not to look up which
Cloudflare account it belongs to — so the account's ID is needed as well.
This is the only time you will be asked for it.

  1. Open this page:  https://dash.cloudflare.com
  2. Choose "Workers & Pages" from the list on the left.
  3. Find "Account ID" on the right-hand side, and copy it.
     (It is also the long code in the address bar, just after
     dash.cloudflare.com/.)

Connect to Cloudflare.

Cloudflare hosts this section's website for free, and it needs to know that
the publishing is coming from you. It does that with an API token — a long
code that acts like a password made just for this app. Creating one takes
about two minutes, and you will not be asked again: it is saved securely on
this computer.

  1. Open this page:  https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
     (Sign in if you are asked to.)
  2. Choose "Create Token", then "Create Custom Token".
  3. Name it something you will recognise later, such as "Class websites".
  4. Give it ONE permission, chosen from the three dropdowns:
     Account  ->  Cloudflare Pages  ->  Edit
  5. Under "Account Resources", choose "Include" and then your own account
     by name. A token that names no account cannot publish anything, and
     what you get back if you skip this does not mention accounts at all.
  6. Under "TTL", set the end date to after the end of your school year —
     next July is a safe choice — or leave it with no end date. An expired
     token stops your publishing working, with nothing to say why.
  7. Choose "Continue to summary", then "Create Token".
  8. Copy the long code Cloudflare shows you — it is only shown once — and
     paste it below. Nothing appears as you paste; that is normal.

MSG
    read -rsp "Paste Cloudflare token: " cf_pasted; echo

Connect to Netlify.

Netlify hosts this section's website for free, and it needs to know that the
publishing is coming from you. It does that with an access token — a long
code that acts like a password made just for this app. Creating one takes
about a minute, and you will not be asked again: it is saved securely on
this computer.

  1. Open this page:
     https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens
     (Sign in if you are asked to.)
  2. Choose "New access token".
  3. Describe it as something you will recognise later, such as
     "Class websites".
  4. Change the expiry — it starts at 7 days. A token that expires stops
     your publishing working, with nothing on screen to say why, so set a
     date after the end of your school year: next July is a safe choice.
     Choose "No expiration" instead if it is offered.
  5. Choose "Generate token", then copy the long code Netlify shows you —
     it is only shown once.
  6. Paste it below. Nothing appears as you paste; that is normal.

MSG
